Be honest and open with your feelings.
 ----- 
 When it comes to decisions, Libra, do what's best for you today. Don't feel like you need to perform certain tasks just because of guilt over a past situation. Do things because you want to, not because you feel obligated to someone else. The only obligation you have is to you.

 ----- 
 Today you may have a difference of opinion with a relative. You will try to resolve this problem.

 ----- 
 Your emotions are more peaceful and easier to control today, Gemini. It's almost as if you're merging with the energy around you. The one thing to be careful of is indecision.

 ----- 
 Your expansive nature is reaching out to others, Virgo, but you may run into opposition. Keep in mind that not everyone wants your advice. Give it only if someone asks for it. It may be in your nature to want to jump into people's lives and fix things. Resist that temptation. What people may need instead is someone to listen.
 ----- 
 Your general mood is at a peak today, although this mood is slightly off due to indecision on your part, Libra. Don't let this get you down.

 ----- 
 You may be tormented by an important decision today, Sagittarius. The good news is that once you make up your mind, you will feel much better about yourself.

 ----- 
 You may be a little hesitant today, Capricorn, and not really sure why. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, another aspect comes up with a completely different perspective.

Take this opportunity to put yourself in other people's shoes so you know how to deal with them in the future.

 You're feeling rather sensitive today, Aries. You may want to rescue every injured animal from the side of the road. Combine this nurturing, loving instinct with a warrior drive that will take charge and lead the fight. This powerful energy duo is very action oriented. Send your loving, internal instincts out into the world to do good.
 ----- 
 Other people may be stroking your fur in the wrong direction, Taurus. There's a great deal of fiery energy in the air today that's promoting a "me first" attitude.

You have your work cut out for you.
 ----- 
 Latch on to what your mind has to say today, Gemini. More than likely, your rational brain knows the right way to go. Your mood may dictate the action, but let your brain handle the steering.

 ----- 
 There's a greater burst of energy coming your way today than there has been in a while, Cancer. It's as if you're making a new start and now is your chance to begin with a fresh new attitude.

 ----- 
 People and situations egg you on today, Leo. It may seem like there's contention around every corner. Remember that your path is the one that you chose. You may or may not have anticipated the barriers, but they're unavoidable. The key to success is to strike the right balance between inner and outer activities. Don't direct all your frustration at others. Don't hold it all in, either.

 Your mood is likely quite good, Scorpio, and you have an added boost of self
 ----- 
 Your brain may be on one side of the fence today while your emotions are on the other, Sagittarius. The challenge will be to find a working resolution between them. Your mind is moving toward a more sensitive and receptive approach, while your heart is in more of an attack mode. Unfortunately, these two energies don't normally work well together. Your job is to find a healthy balance.
 ----- 
 One of the themes today is giving versus receiving. You may be asked to handle many tasks at once, something you're naturally quite good at, Capricorn. There's a strong need to take action and get things done, while you may also feel a strong inward pull asking you to settle down and reflect. Both are valid emotions, and both should be honored as you go through your day.
 ----- 
 You're in line with your warrior instincts today, Aquarius, which reminds you to align with your dreams. The tricky part is how you're going to plan your attack so that there's an equal balance of give and take. Today's prevailing energies may catch you in a difficult situation. Sometimes an outwardly directed, argumentative approach is the only way to push through the roadblock.

 Something about silence doesn't seem right to you today, Aries. Keep talking. Eventually someone will say something meaningful.

Realize that you have important information to share with those around you. Your critical, practical, grounded opinion plays a key role in the activities of the day.
 ----- 
 Strong forces may act up today and ask you to stand up a little straighter than usual, Virgo. Keep your shoulders back and be proud. Don't think any less of yourself just because there is disagreement between you and others. Maintain respect for your opinions. Say things with confidence and don't back down, but be prepared to defend your views.
 ----- 
 Feel free to take the lazy route today, Libra. Don't lift a finger if you don't have to. It may be hard to get others moving, too. You can prod all you want, but if people don't want to go, they aren't going to go. Your flexible nature might be tested. You may find that you need to adapt to the whims of others rather than the other way around.
 ----- 
 Your thinking is steady and reserved today, Scorpio. Your mind is right in line with your ego, and you will be able to accurately verbalize what is going on inside. You might be a bit reserved in how much you tell people. It could be that others are holding back information from you. Proceed with caution and be honest in all your dealings.
 ----- 
 Today is an excellent day to say exactly how you feel, Sagittarius. Your thinking is sharp and clear. Once you start talking, you may never stop. People will listen extra carefully to your words. You have a great deal of influence, so realize how much impact you have on the environment. You will be able to accomplish a lot.
 ----- 
 You might find that your brain is moving in the slow lane today, Capricorn. It may even be creeping over to the breakdown lane. You might find that it's a bit harder to make your witty rebuttals in conversation. Take your time and make sure you choose your words carefully. Communicating with others might be a bit like pulling teeth.
 ----- 
 Words may not be the best way to communicate things today, Aquarius. Body language, touch, and taste will be much more effective. You will find that your senses are heightened. Let your feet follow your nose and go enjoy a good meal with someone special tonight.
 ----- 
 Things may get quite intense today, Pisces. There will be a great deal of information coming your way, but it might not all be that good. It seems that someone is putting a roadblock in your path, making it difficult for you to pass. Don't let this stop you. Use your creativity to find ways around any obstacles. Experiences like these only make you stronger.
 ----- 
 Remind your loved ones how much they mean to you today, Aries. Words are especially powerful. Don't use them lightly. Be thoughtful about how you treat others. Do your best to maintain peace. It isn't a good idea to hold grudges or carry hatred for anyone. Good manners and a neat appearance are key elements to the day.
 ----- 
 Feel free to express your independent attitude today, Taurus. Break out of any restrictions that might be keeping you from doing what you want to do. Also, make sure you aren't compromising your own needs for those of others. Things should naturally flow your way, and you should be in a good mood for most of your waking hours. Smile at the people around you.
 ----- 
 Have fun today and don't be so serious about anything, Gemini. This is a good time to lay low and enjoy the scenery. Go to a movie or see a play. Go to a party and celebrate. Dress up in your most attractive garb and go in for the kill. This is a day to be talkative, lighthearted, and social. Heavy emotional issues will only weigh down the positive mood.
 ----- 
 You can do no wrong today, Cancer. In fact, you can navigate through the cracks without anyone noticing. You may find that you would rather be up on center stage. This is fine, too, just as long as the choice is yours. Independence is a key theme for you today. You will find that the more you can break free, the better your mood will be.
 ----- 
 Have some fun today, Leo. It's time to balance all the work you've been doing with a little bit of fun. Yesterday's honest efforts are turning into today's rewards. There's no need to be shy when it comes to receiving what is rightfully yours. Be proud of your accomplishments. If you can't find someone to take you out to dinner, take yourself out!
 ----- 
 The pace will be jumping today and your wit and cheerful words will be welcomed in almost every setting you enter, Virgo. Do things with others and see what kind of "trouble" you can stir up together. This is a time to get out and be social. Beautiful things and relaxing music are all favored on a day like this. You can do no wrong by just being your usual, outlandish self!
 ----- 
 Many people may have a great deal to say today, Libra, but you could find that you'd rather sit and listen. Feel free to do so. A lot of what's going around is gossip, so you might not want to get involved at all. This is probably a wise move. Keep your nose clean and simply absorb what you hear. Feel free to filter out anything that doesn't sit right with you.
 ----- 
 Don't be selfish today, Scorpio. This is a time to think about others. Instead of plowing ahead with a project by yourself, consider enlisting the help of a partner or friend. Things are better accomplished cooperatively, regardless of how badly you may want to do something on your own. The effort put out by a team will produce unexpected results that prove quite favorable.
 ----- 
 If you don't say exactly what you mean today, Sagittarius, you might get into trouble. Don't compromise your values just to maintain the peace. Love and romance are favorable for you, but only if your attitude is relaxed and carefree. Your emotions will be quite strong, so do your best to balance them with a rational frame of mind.
 ----- 
 Today is apt to be favorable for you, Capricorn. You should keep the lines of communication open so you can spread your knowledge to others and receive the important information that is due to come your way. Your energy might come in erratic yet powerful bursts. You should find that your ego and emotions are quite strong.
 ----- 
 You might feel a bit restless today, Aquarius. You may want to get the word out to others. Unfortunately, your tongue may be tied and it could be hard for you to express yourself exactly the way you want. Balance is key. You should work to foster harmony among your associates. This is a good time to get out and be social.
 ----- 
 If you keep waiting for things to happen, Pisces, you may wake up one morning and realize that your life has passed and you never did half the things you dreamed of doing. The time to take action is now. Put your plan into effect. You may need to make some compromises, but you will find that, in general, people will follow your lead.
 ----- 
 Every time you bring up a sensitive, important, or deep subject, does someone squash it? You may feel like you aren't relating well to other people today, Aries. You may want to dive deeper into issues while others prefer to skim the surface. There are many ways to see the same things and deal with the same problems. Find people who see things your way rather than fight those who don't.
 ----- 
 This is a wonderful day. You feel emotionally strong, Taurus. You have all of your energy available for use. Don't miss this opportunity by feigning a headache and staying at home doing nothing. Instead of analyzing everything and criticizing everyone else's life, look at your own and see what choices you can make right now. Take the best course of action based on the resources you have at your fingertips.
 ----- 
 Nothing seems to be clicking the way you want, Gemini. Your rational mind tells you that things are fine and you have the green light to proceed with your plans. But there's a small voice inside you that's suggesting otherwise. Perhaps you have an inkling that your plan is flawed in some way. Perhaps you're ignoring a certain pain in your heart by keeping it secret when in reality you need to let it out.
 ----- 
 You're emotionally much stronger than usual. You will be surprised at the events, thoughts, and conversations you command with your words, Cancer. Most of the time, you follow others. You go with the flow. You're laid
 ----- 
 While this may be a day when all you want to do is to relax, you may not feel like you can, Leo. A little voice is telling you to work. Perhaps you're inspired to clean out your closet, change the landscaping, or wash your windows. Put these tasks aside. Forced manual labor isn't the way to go today. If you're going to put that much energy into something, put it into having fun.
 ----- 
 This may feel like a day made just for you, Virgo. You're emotionally strong. You feel like you're able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Tackle all those projects you love but have been too scared to start. You have a great deal of energy and confidence in your favor. You will succeed in almost anything you try, so don't waste this moment by just watching TV.
 ----- 
 Your energy may be a bit scattered, Libra. Although your days are jam
 ----- 
 Your emotions and actions are well aligned, Scorpio, meaning that you're likely to do things that are more in tune with your true beliefs. This wonderful alignment of energies will keep you busy and out of trouble. As long as you're true to yourself, no one can argue with what you do or who you are. There is no reason for you to make excuses about anything.
 ----- 
 You may feel emotionally stuck, Sagittarius. Perhaps you feel your sensitive, loving nature isn't fully appreciated. Today is energetic and lively, but you'd rather sit home and relax. Your best strategy is to do just that. Why is it so hard for some people to see that doing nothing is really doing something 
 ----- 
 It feels like you have more emotional armor on, Capricorn, which will help you deal with a looming battle. Somewhere in your world a conflict is brewing. It may not be obvious, it may not be large, but it's there. Today you're more prepared to deal with things out in the open. You have a larger arsenal of weapons, and your witty, aggressive banter is at a peak.
 ----- 
 You may feel like your resources are depleted and you want to throw in the towel, Aquarius. Don't give up yet. Today may not be the best day of your life, but that doesn't mean you should write everyone off and become a hermit. You may be moodier than usual, but you will snap out of it. You may need to be a bit more adaptable in order to roll with the punches today.
 ----- 
 Your energy is running high, Pisces, and you have a great deal of fire that you can use to transform anything. You have a wonderful capacity to turn a bad situation into a good one. You know exactly how to lift others' spirits when they're down. Today certain issues may be a bit too emotional for you to handle comfortably. There's an aggressive, combative tone to some people. Keep your guard up.
 ----- 
 Today you can expect to be more enterprising in your human relationships, Aries. You may find new friends or enjoy quality time with old ones. It's likely that your love life will intensify. The next few weeks provide excellent resources for improving your emotional well
 ----- 
 The past month has allowed you to affirm yourself, Taurus, and cement some aspects of your personality. You're now entering a period of consolidation. It's like you conceived a product, created it, and are now finally ready to put it on the market. The current period indicates that you will receive all of the rewards that your hard work has earned.
 ----- 
 Today heralds the beginning of a very agreeable period. You will be especially happy, Gemini! You will project confidence, clarity, and charisma wherever you go. You used up a lot of your reserves during the last few months. You've made it to this stage just in time. Certainly you'll agree that this is something to be celebrated!
 ----- 
 Cancer, this would be a good moment to get rid of anything that still stands between you and achieving your goals. A certain obstacle might be sparking the impulse you have to blend into the background. Don't forget that you're an individual. This isn't something to be overcome. It should be celebrated!
 ----- 
 The signs say that you can expect a very profitable few weeks ahead, Leo. You've worked hard lately, and it's only natural that you have finally arrived at this stage. You're going to be able to measure the distance you've come and evaluate your power. Whatever you do, don't think small!
 ----- 
 The cosmos will ask you to make more of an effort, Virgo. To do so means you will have to come back down to Earth and join the rest of us mere mortals. You may be cultivating your independence a bit too much. You seem to be pulling away from people. You should try to mix more and get involved in a cause that's bigger than you. Accept working with others as a necessary component of your life.
 ----- 
 A quest is in store for you, Libra. You're likely to engage in a search for physical or intellectual space. You may be asking yourself philosophical questions. Or perhaps you're thinking of taking a long trip. Which will it be? Will you read philosophy or go to China? At this point, only the stars know.
 ----- 
 In navigating your emotional life, Scorpio, you may feel you've made a great effort in the past month. You've been available and conciliatory, and done your best to maintain harmony. Your efforts have paid off. Now you feel a yen for more spontaneity. It seems that the enterprising and reckless you has returned! Go ahead 
 ----- 
 Sagittarius, the cosmic signs indicate that your emotional universe will once again glow with positive energy. You will meet more people, and your encounters are likely to be profoundly gratifying, emotionally and intellectually. All told, the coming month is wonderfully promising for you. Two key things to anticipate are pleasure and sensuality.
 ----- 
 For you, Capricorn, the next few weeks portend a period of timidity. You will probably go out less, introduce yourself to fewer new people, and be less prone to showing off. But any relationships you do form will be much more intense than usual. The month ahead is quite promising, though you may have to readjust some of your attitudes.
 ----- 
 You may have spent the past few weeks exploring other horizons, Aquarius, meeting new people, going out more frequently, or taking short trips. But there's a significant change of rhythm in the air. You will settle down and bask in the comfort of your home. You will find that you have just the incentive you need to stabilize yourself for a while. Expect some pleasurable moments in the domestic realm.
 ----- 
 You're likely to enjoy a change in the rhythm and quality of life, beginning right now, Pisces. Do you feel a need to take your friendships beyond superficiality? Perhaps you should reestablish contact with some past friends. After a hiatus, you may have some bonds to repair. You can expect another period devoted to sweeping the cobwebs out of your emotional life and letting in light and promise.
 ----- 
 If you're prepared and well organized, Aries, today should go smoothly and pleasantly. Feel free to indulge in fanciful daydreams and things of a whimsical nature. You've earned the right to break from the normal routine. If you've been slacking off your tasks, however, you will now need to spend some time catching up and planning ahead.
 ----- 
 Don't feel badly about things you have no control over, Taurus. Tonight it would be good for you to go out and have a nice time. Put aside your responsibilities and concentrate on fun. It might be difficult to jump
 ----- 
 You may find it hard to sit still today, Gemini. People may pull your chain right and left in order to get a rise out of you. Whatever seems grounded and solid may end up being flimsy and detached. Beware of where you step. The ground is apt to give way with little warning. Your appetite may be ravenous, but it's likely there won't be nearly enough nourishment to satisfy you.
 ----- 
 Be careful who you trust today, Cancer. Instead of venturing out, you might prefer to stick close to home and enjoy the comforts you've worked so hard to attain. Don't entrust just anyone with your secrets. Information is likely to be misinterpreted and what you say might not be taken as seriously as you'd like it to be.
 ----- 
 What looks like solid ground may be quicksand, Leo. Be careful where you step. There's an element of misunderstanding to the day that might make it difficult to get through to people. The good news is that your emotions are quite solid. Your inner stability should help you keep a healthy frame of mind, regardless of the events that transpire.
 ----- 
 You may have your head in the clouds today, Virgo. At the same time, there's a need for you to keep your feet on the ground. This contradiction of energies might make it difficult to find peace, but you should find comfort knowing that this will soon end. Deal with conflicting issues the best you can. They will help you find the balance and perspective you need.
 ----- 
 Your emotions may be playing tricks on you, Libra. You may find it hard to deal with reality. Take the day to relax and unwind. Don't worry about the details. Concentrate more on your general state of mind. Things will go smoothly when you focus on radiating positive energy to others. Don't worry so much about the consequences. Focus more on the process.
 ----- 
 You might find it hard to make progress with your projects today, Scorpio, especially if you need others' help. There's a stubborn quality to the day that's causing things to get jammed up. When neither party budges, the result is chaos. You might have to give a little in order to get a little. Be the first one to release your grip and things will run more smoothly.
 ----- 
 This should be a pretty good day, Sagittarius. You will find a greater than usual sensitivity to your needs. One thing to be aware of is fast talkers who might make elaborate promises that they have no intention of keeping. Slow and steady wins the race, and you're the master of this technique. Your patience and sensitivity are invaluable on a day like this.
 ----- 
 Capricorn, you may have recently built fanciful scenarios in your head regarding how you think things should be, in either a romantic, business, or family situation. It's likely these images will conflict with reality as you discover that you need to take a much more analytical approach to what you have going.
 ----- 
 The place you arrive at today may not be quite what you expected, Aquarius. Once you get there, you will find that there is sudden opposition in your camp. Things may not always be exactly what they seem, so check your facts before you make any major decisions. It's better to get the information right from the source rather than depend on what you hear through the grapevine.
 ----- 
 Your actions might be a bit strained today, Pisces. People aren't going to cooperate in the way you might like them to. It could be one of those days in which it's difficult to get things done simply because other people seem to get in the way. Try not to get angry. Perhaps you need to take a break and relax. The harder you push, the more resistance you will encounter.
 ----- 
 It's certainly clear that you have faith in your actions, Aries! You feel no fear or doubt as you progress toward your goals at a fast clip, cruising along on calm seas under clear skies. This new atmosphere is likely the product of your renewed commitment. Reward yourself for your accomplishments, but you should wait a few days before launching an all
 ----- 
 This is a moment to start being creative and stop worrying that you don't have talent, Taurus. Who's to say what "talent" is? In the romance department, the love of your life might be right under your nose. Try lifting your eyes from the romance novels and look around. The perfect mate could be any number of people in your daily life. You just have to open your eyes.
 ----- 
 You may be a bit unclear about your professional direction today, Gemini. Your motivation has disappeared without warning. What happened? It may be that you need to become involved in projects that have more universal resonance. Projects that concern only your interests or that are of narrow scope no longer hold your attention.
 ----- 
 You could be seeing mirages at the moment, Cancer, most notably in the environment around you. You may have the impression that people are lying to you or that they're hiding something from you. Or it may be that you're the one who lies about certain things or hides what you do. Why are you making it all so complicated? Don't be afraid to express your feelings.
 ----- 
 Hold on to your wallet, Leo, because you may have some strange {though noble) impulses to give away your money or spend a large amount on something useless. You should think about spending your money in a better way or not at all. Why not consider donating some of your time rather than money to those in need?
 ----- 
 Today isn't a good day to sign contracts or make any substantial purchases, Virgo. Go to the grocery store, by all means, but buy hamburger, not tenderloin. Keep your money at home and safeguard your reserves. Don't negotiate about anything. No matter how good the offer sounds or how compelling the deal, walk away.
 ----- 
 Are you certain you can't modify your current situation, Libra? Are you a prisoner of a lifestyle that isn't of your own making or is a throwback to the past? People have been asking you to take on too many responsibilities and this is weighing you down. Don't be afraid to distance yourself from these situations. Learn to say no.
 ----- 
 The forecast for you is excellent, Scorpio. You can rely on today's aspects to restore your self
 ----- 
 You may have some trouble communicating today, Sagittarius. It's as though something is distorting your perception. Don't be surprised if once evening comes you feel like forgetting about everything and traveling to the other side of the world. Tomorrow you will see clearly again. Without a doubt, there are adventures in store for you!
 ----- 
 You are radiant and glowing with happiness today, Capricorn! This is a refreshing change after the gloom of the past few weeks. Apparently, the decisions you made worked out for the best. Or even better, perhaps you're in love? In any case, it will be even easier than usual for you to communicate with others and share your joy. Let the good times roll!
 ----- 
 Your goal for today is to enchant your mate. There's no reason not to try. Indeed, it's an excellent day for love. But don't exaggerate your seductive wiles, Aquarius. Since the day's aspects tend to distort your perception of things, you may be deceived by what you see in the mirror. Be careful about what you do and how you do it!
 ----- 
 You're in splendid shape today, Pisces! Did a fairy godmother brandish a magic wand to dispel all the little difficulties of the past few weeks? Enjoy this moment of relief from worries. As for your love life, some exciting opportunities may arise. Be on the lookout for them. Whatever you do, don't let them pass you by!
 ----- 
 Try not to get too worked up over other people's actions that don't concern you, Aries. Recent events may have triggered responses from others that now have a serious effect on you. Take some time to really think about what part you wish to play in this drama. Is it in your best interests to get involved? It's undoubtedly time to distance yourself from the situation.
 ----- 
 Emotionally, you should feel good today, Taurus, so don't let this confidence go to waste. Do things with your sweetheart and turn the dial up on romance. Your inner light is shining brightly, so know that you can use this to illuminate the path for others. Offer a sympathetic ear and comforting shoulder for someone to cry on tonight. People will be drawn to you like steel to a magnet.
 ----- 
 As much as you try to explain things, Gemini, others simply aren't going to see them with your same intensity and do
 ----- 
 Feel free to ignite your passion with the help of the people around you, Cancer. Join with those who share similar dreams and make a plan for accomplishing whatever you choose. The more creative you can be with your planning, data collecting, and execution, the better off you will be. The white
 ----- 
 You may get caught up in gossip if you aren't careful, Leo, and people may find this off
 ----- 
 Your enthusiasm is contagious, Virgo, and you should do what you can to share this feeling with others. In matters of the heart, have confidence that you know exactly where you stand. You also have the map of the surrounding area and beyond. You have the ability to get to any place you want to go. Accept the power that comes from strong connections in you and with people around you.
 ----- 
 You may be at a high point right now and feeling very excited about things to come, Libra. You probably anticipate but have only a vague notion of what's just over the horizon. You may have a strong desire to rise high so you can see farther. In fact, you probably think that any place is better than your current spot. Have confidence in your future. It looks extremely bright.
 ----- 
 Let your heart be the reassuring force in your life today if difficult emotional issues come to the surface, Scorpio. Your feelings are apt to be at a climactic point in your month. Your general sensitivity toward the world is heightened. Try not to get too weighed down by these inner stirrings.
 ----- 
 Be open and communicative about your feelings today, Sagittarius. Most people find it easy to share facts or concrete information. The challenge is to share something from your heart. Don't think that feelings always need to be kept secret. Just the opposite is true. Make sure you leave the channels open for emotional expression.
 ----- 
 When you enter a room, Capricorn, the dynamic suddenly changes. Your presence has a powerful impact on other people. Don't take it lightly. People may hang on your words like they're listening to the queen address to her kingdom. Make sure the content of your speech reflects the gravity of the situation. Make every word count.
 ----- 
 When it comes to issues of love and romance, you're likely to be in a tough situation, Aquarius. The problem is that it may seem like there's an element of detachment developing. Your partner may be moving away from you instead of toward you. Either that, or you feel that he or she simply isn't relating to you as intimately as you'd like.
 ----- 
 Your self
 ----- 
 How do you preserve your family history, Aries? Do you keep mementos in a box, display heirlooms, or make scrapbooks? You most likely realize the value of family history, but you might not preserve it as well as you should. Take steps to record and save precious items and memories from parents, grandparents, siblings, and others. Don't forget your own history, too. One day you will be glad you did.
 ----- 
 Overdue apologies can be made today, Taurus. It isn't easy to admit you're wrong, but the planetary aspects can boost your courage. Rather than stew with regret, meet with the person to make amends. Regardless of any discomfort, you will definitely find that you feel a lot better afterward. Even if the other person isn't receptive, you will be able to say what needs to be said.
 ----- 
 Your dreams are more than just random firings of neurons, Gemini. They can indicate unresolved issues, stress, deep desires, and lost memories. They can prove instrumental to understanding yourself and solving problems. Keep a dream journal and you can access the power within your subconscious and all you can learn from it. Examine your recent dreams. See if there's something you need to recognize.
 ----- 
 If you've been tired lately, Cancer, it may be due to stress. Today's aspects bring an added energy to communication. It would be wise to talk about some of the stress. Worry, anxiety, and fear are huge drains on physical and emotional health. Exercise can alleviate some of these. For others, talking is key. Find the most effective ways to rid yourself of such energy drains and feel better.
 ----- 
 It's a good day to express your thoughts and feelings, Leo. Whether it's a loved one who'd appreciate affectionate words or a colleague who requires instruction, communication will come more easily than usual. You have a practical nature. Often you say what you think is required and not much else. Yet others may need you to say a lot more. Consider this as you go about your day.
 ----- 
 Spread goodwill and affection today, Virgo. It's been a while since you let people know that you care about and appreciate them. Cards, phone calls, letters, flowers, and hugs are ways to express your feelings. Consider surprising someone with lunch, or making something special for a friend. Make time for emotional as well as intellectual expression. It keeps a healthy balance in your life.
 ----- 
 If a problem comes your way today, Libra, look for the simplest solution. Not every problem is complicated. Often the most obvious answer is the best one. Try to keep your emotions out of problems that require calculation and thought. They can obscure the view and keep you from seeing what's right in front of you. Draw strength from your common sense. Rule things out by process of elimination.
 ----- 
 It's a good day to speak your mind, Scorpio. Not that you generally have much trouble with this. But even you can face situations where you feel intimidated and hesitant to speak up. Not today. There aren't going to be any circumstances you can't handle, because the astral energy will boost your abilities. If there's someone you've been reluctant to approach, make a move to talk to him or her.
 ----- 
 Expect a boost to your communication skills today, Sagittarius. If you often experience difficulty expressing your true feelings, this will be a welcome change for you. Consider talking things over with anyone you have unresolved issues with. With added strength and confidence, you should be able to work the problems out quickly and relatively painlessly.
 ----- 
 If something has been bothering you, Capricorn, today is a good time to work it out. Your excellent communicative ability will be even stronger with today's energy. Whether your problems have to do with a colleague, boss, spouse, friend, or relative, you will find the words to effectively communicate your thoughts and feelings. Don't hesitate to make those appointments.
 ----- 
 You can be quiet and reclusive when it comes to expressing feelings, Aquarius. Today may be the exception. The aspects can bring real strength to your communication abilities. You'd be wise to seize the opportunity. Take steps to express your feelings by initiating conversations. Words will come much more easily than usual. If there are problems to handle, you will likely find resolutions.
 ----- 
 When did you last spend real quality time with your family 
 ----- 
 You may not know which way to turn, Aries. You may be emotionally weighed down by sentimental feelings and memories that bind you to the past. You may also feel restricted by authority figures who've been around the block more times than you, and therefore feel they have the right to tell you how to run your life. Try not to let your thoughts get tied up in either of these scenarios.
 ----- 
 Your mind may be going in many different directions, with fantastic ideas about how things should be done, Taurus. The difficulty is communicating these ideas in a way that makes sense. Others may see you as a threat to their authority. Perhaps they feel your ideas would undermine their plans, so they reject them. Don't give up. Fight for your right to be heard and respected.
 ----- 
 In a philosophical or political conversation, you don't hesitate to offer your thoughts, Gemini. Your examples may be extreme, but your principles are sound. You may get in over your head before you know it and suddenly need an escape route. Your first reaction may be to change the subject. It's better to admit you don't know the answer or don't understand the question.
 ----- 
 You should be in a good mood, Cancer, although you might have a hard time fully expressing yourself. Perhaps you feel like there is someone keeping an eye on your every move. You may feel like a kid in class being watched by the teacher. Don't be intimidated by those with a self
 ----- 
 You may get the feeling that despite all the hard work you've accomplished, something is still missing, Leo. There's still a long road ahead, regardless of the goals you've attained so far. Perhaps the thing you're searching for is a tender moment with a loved one, something that's much closer than you think. Stop searching far and wide for the thing that's right under your nose.
 ----- 
 Freedom may be a theme for you today, Virgo. You're beginning to question what it is you're trying to free yourself from. A person? Job? Commitment? These may be the very things you start to search for as soon as you're free of them. Trying to figure out what you want and need in life is sometimes easier said than done. Don't get stuck on one concept. Do your best to take things gradually.
 ----- 
 You're the liquid that takes the shape of its container, Libra. Even though this may seem like the most non
 ----- 
 You may feel like a puppy that has been let outside for the first time, Scorpio. The air is warm and you're full of energy. You're ready to run over the fields and hills. Unfortunately, you're tied to a stake and you can't move beyond a ten
 ----- 
 You may feel a strange tension. It seems that nothing you say or do is quite right, Sagittarius. As much as you may try to do the correct thing, you can't make things click the way you'd like. Try not to raise your expectations too high. Let go of the idea that things are going to work out exactly the way you want. You may not even know what's best for you in the end.
 ----- 
 It may be hard for you to maintain your self
 ----- 
 If you're unclear about the topic of discussion, say so, Aquarius. Asking questions is an important part of learning. You shouldn't be afraid to ask. Communication may take on a serious tone, and intellectual discussions are likely to get heated. Bring up political topics at the dinner table and give everyone a chance to speak on the matter. Don't try to change the subject in order to avoid the conversation.
 ----- 
 You may be shy when it comes to expressing your emotions today, Pisces. This could be a rare thing for you. Other people may wonder if something is wrong. The truth is, you may feel like you need to calm down and focus more of your attention inward instead of directing it outward. Don't look to others to resolve your problems. Deal with them yourself. You're just going through an introspective period.
 ----- 
 The day ahead will suit you, but you mustn't expect miracles. Now is a time of healing. In the weeks ahead you will restore harmony to your energies and regain your fitness with improved diet and lifestyle. Your emotional life gets an overhaul as well, as you find the courage to confront certain unsettling issues.
 ----- 
 Yes, Taurus, you haven't finished all the cleaning up that remains in many areas. You're going to have to get your papers in order, pay off old debts, face physical or moral obligations, and fix technical problems. That's a lot of work! Fortunately, once it's done, your emotional baggage will be considerably lighter, enabling you to go farther and faster.
 ----- 
 The astral energy says there's a time for everything. We tend to repeat certain tasks we like doing, while those we dislike we try to get out of the way as quickly as possible. It seems reasonable, but the Universe reminds you that you should make as much space in your life for what you don't like as for what you do, because each task is related to the other in some way.
 ----- 
 Reality isn't always as exciting as you'd like it to be, Cancer. But isn't this because you interpret reality in a particular way? You rarely look at things in detail, because fundamentally, details don't interest you. But if you look around, you will discover that the details of a truly epic event are currently unfolding before your eyes. Put some new lenses in your glasses!
 ----- 
 The planetary energies are encouraging you to make some adjustments regarding your social ambitions. You may desire to change professions or your circle of friends. This is trickier than you might think, as the culture of your current world is an extension of you. You're drawn to what's familiar. Your natural tendency will be to go back to where you came from.
 ----- 
 This planetary energy is going to test your recurring desire to go to the other side of the world or have a ready exit in any relationship. You do this so you won't feel trapped and, above all, so you won't be dependent. This is one of your strengths, Virgo, but it's also one of your weaknesses. Throughout the next few weeks you will be pushed to involve yourself more intimately with others.
 ----- 
 Why do you find relationships difficult, Libra? You know interactions with others help you learn and grow. This is the case for everyone. But for you, especially, relationships are important because they help keep you grounded. Too often you dream about reality rather than confront it. Today's aspects are going to insist that you make a greater effort with the people closest to you.
 ----- 
 The end of one cycle signals the beginning of a new one. Today, you will embark on a new period of understanding that harmonizes your energies. You may have taken more risks than usual lately as you exposed emotions you normally keep hidden. Did you overdo it or could you have gone even further out on that limb? You have a period of clarity ahead to think about it.
 ----- 
 Have you noticed a certain strain on your emotions, Sagittarius? You're resilient, but even you have found all the recent intensity a bit too much. You can relax now. The next few weeks promise to be calmer. Sunnier skies will gradually return. Your efforts will concentrate on your love life. You know you need security and stability. If you work steadily, you will attain those goals!
 ----- 
 The past few weeks may have seemed Earth shattering, Capricorn. You may still be trembling slightly as you head into the coming weeks. Fortunately, the current astral configuration promises to be calmer, although not necessarily less intense. You will be able to apply recent decisions regarding your domestic life and finally settle some important matters.
 ----- 
 You may be sensitive, Aquarius, but you're also persistent. The waves you've surfed in the past few weeks have only strengthened your resolve. However, you will have to be satisfied with this past period of thrills. The weeks ahead will be much quieter. Use the time to regain some control over your life and work hard to simplify your attitudes.
 ----- 
 Perhaps the last few weeks impressed you as one of the most intense periods yet in this year. You will certainly admit that anything related to affairs of the heart was endowed with profound and lasting meaning. It's now time for a physical and psychological rest in order to let you fully integrate your experiences. The weeks ahead offer a calm and quiet oasis.
 ----- 
 You may feel the urge to get up and go today, Aries. Follow this instinct and get to work. You're anxious to get the ball rolling on certain projects. The key for you now is to make sure that the ones that are already started get done before you tackle the others. Don't let people stand in the way of your progress. Grab hold of the reins if you need to.
 ----- 
 You may find that there is some opposition from other people today, Taurus, especially concerning emotions. You may feel threatened in some way. An aggressive attitude could be making you feel inferior or unworthy of certain attention. Wanting peace, justice, and harmony doesn't make you wimpy or inferior, as some people may suggest. These qualities are your strengths, not your weaknesses.
 ----- 
 You're terrific at following through with projects, Gemini, but perhaps not so great at starting them. Today is the perfect time for you to prove this theory wrong. There's a great deal of force out there to help you boost your rocket off the launching pad. Take advantage of this energy and get to work on things you've been meaning to start but haven't gotten around to yet.
 ----- 
 Your self
 ----- 
 There may be a bit of tension and conflict in your world today, Leo. Be prepared for mild contention that could turn into an all
 ----- 
 There may be tension in your heart today that could be difficult to shake, Virgo. You might find it hard to relate to people or that others aren't hearing you very well. Keep in mind that you may have to translate your thoughts in order to get your message across. Keep an open mind as you deal with others on a one
 ----- 
 Try not to be impatient today, Libra. This could be one day in which you feel restless, and everything seems to take much longer than you'd like. Try your best to go with the flow. Don't get so wrapped up in making sure things happen by a certain time. Quality is more important than speed, and a peaceful mind is more efficient and productive than a stressed one.
 ----- 
 To fight or not to fight may be the question of the day, Scorpio. Your sensitive, feminine side is likely to say one thing while your masculine, combative side says another. The key is to not act hastily in any situation. Make sure you proceed from a neutral platform instead of reacting from a point of aggression caused by someone else.
 ----- 
 Be careful that you don't put your foot in your mouth today, Sagittarius. You may have a tendency to jump the gun, so be conscious of how you use your energy. A false start is likely to get you disqualified. Orient yourself to your surroundings before you make any major upheaval. It's important to have a good, solid footing on the day before you proceed.
 ----- 
 This could be a highly productive day for you if you approach it in the right way. You will find that you have an added burst of energy that could help you conquer just about any task you set your mind to, Capricorn. You may feel more aggressive than usual, so use this to your advantage by delegating tasks and moving forward on projects that you'd like to see done.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit anxious today, Aquarius, and it may be hard to settle down. You probably have many irons in the fire right now, and they're all starting to heat up at once. Unfortunately, other people may not be especially sensitive to your needs, so beware. It might be best to put up some sort of psychic shield to protect yourself from other people's moods.
 ----- 
 Your heart should feel quite generous today, Pisces. You're most likely feeling the need to keep everyone smiling. Spread your radiant sunshine everywhere 
 ----- 
 Recent hesitation on your part may have suddenly put you in a bind, Aries. It may feel like you've reached gridlock and your choices are limited. You can no longer get a solid handle on things. Instead of trying to make a move now, you may have to wait until the dust settles and you can see clearly again. Let the situation release before you add any more friction.
 ----- 
 There are powerful forces operating now, Taurus. Whether you realize it or not, you have tremendous control over the direction of these energies. Take control of the situation instead of letting someone else do it for you. You will find that other people are more malleable than usual, making them quite willing to move forward in whatever direction you point them.
 ----- 
 If conflict arises in your world, Gemini, you must keep in mind that there is no one else to blame except you. Keeping your sights set on one goal is useful as you concentrate all your energy toward that one thing. At the same time, you may be losing perspective on what's going on around you. Make sure you continue to be a team player by keeping an eye out for the people in the wings.
 ----- 
 Life may seem like a great train ride, Cancer. You have your own little compartment that you're striving to keep comfortable and neat. The company you keep is important, as is your proximity to the food car. Be careful that you don't get so wrapped up in your own little world that you neglect to pay heed to where the train is headed.
 ----- 
 You need to learn an important lesson in follow
 ----- 
 Be careful about being driven so strongly that you fail to take into consideration the changing environment, Virgo. Things have probably changed quite a bit since you first set out on this mission. You may have packed for sunshine and suddenly it looks like rain. Put away your sunglasses and take out your umbrella. It's important that you adapt to unexpected change.
 ----- 
 You may be hit with some extreme circumstances that cause you to feel uneasy about continuing along your path, Libra. Use this jolt as a reminder that nothing is set in stone. An element of the unexpected can always creep up on you. Deep down, you probably had a feeling that this difficult situation was bound to happen eventually.
 ----- 
 You may feel like you're on a road to adventure and excited about the frontiers you're encountering, Scorpio. Unfortunately, it seems that not everyone is as excited about this path as you are. Blows to your ego are apt to hit hard, but try not to let this deter you. This is more than likely a result of other people's jealousy of your incredible strength and bravery.
 ----- 
 There's a tremendously sensitive side to your personality that's tender and extremely vulnerable, Sagittarius. Be careful about putting too much of yourself out there now. By opening yourself up so much, you're inviting in trouble. Others might not be that aware of how sensitive you are. Those with strong, boisterous spirits are likely to be abrasive, so protect your emotions.
 ----- 
 You may be in a difficult position, Capricorn, as a critical part of a pending decision. Your first reaction may be to throw up your hands and leave the decision to someone else. Making a choice is too tough, so you find that you'd rather not have to make it at all. Unfortunately, it looks like everyone else has the same idea. Deep down, you have an opinion that needs to be heard.
 ----- 
 Your self
 ----- 
 A ray of sunshine is likely to shine on you, Pisces. Things may have been cloudy lately, making it harder for you to maintain a positive disposition. Today's news will be uplifting, and you will likely be reminded of all the good times in store for you. Others may feel a bit of stress, but you should be able to see through this and appreciate the benefits of the situation.
 ----- 
 If you have ties to any therapeutic profession, Aries, you may make a strange discovery related to the health field today. You won't find this discovery in any book or methodology that you normally follow. Emotions aren't so blind as rational society would have us believe! Sometimes they lead us down the road toward knowledge. That's the case today.
 ----- 
 It's like you have to do everything at the same time right now, Taurus. What you really need is an extra pair of hands and some additional hours in the day! It's your nerves that may pay the price for this fast
 ----- 
 Why do so many relationships seem to come with built
 ----- 
 This is going to be a day to protect your sense of space and privacy, Cancer. You may be forced into some kind of partnership with some unscrupulous people. They're going to make you feel like your territory is being invaded. What they don't know is that you're prepared. This isn't a time for people to be bothering you!
 ----- 
 Expect to have to make some adjustments in your love life, Leo. You may be in a different frame of mind than your partner. Why not use the day to step back from the relationship? Spend time apart for a change. After all, there's nothing dramatic about the fact that your needs and desires aren't in sync. It's only temporary.
 ----- 
 You may find today a bit upsetting, Virgo. Your nurturing instincts genuinely want to assist the many people who ask for your help and advice, yet you can't shake the feeling that they're taking advantage of you or trying to make you do things you don't want to do. Yes, it's hard to be a good parent to others and yourself at the same time.
 ----- 
 How irritating to realize that those pesky problems from the past haven't been resolved, Libra! Today you will have the strength and awareness to put these problems to rest simply by talking about them. Ironically, the reproaches made by your partner are what spark the change in attitude that you need.
 ----- 
 Continue slowly and steadily, Scorpio. You may get all worked up over nothing because you want everything done at once! It would be a good time to prioritize what you really want to do. Be cautious of anything that distracts you. You have such a great desire to live through extraordinary experiences. Give yourself the time to completely experience them!
 ----- 
 For a few months now, you've felt that things are accelerating in your professional life, Sagittarius. Perhaps some projects have developed more quickly than you anticipated. They may have even gotten a bit out of control. Today you should let yourself distinguish more clearly what you've done so far. You may be in for a surprise.
 ----- 
 If by chance you have to speak in public soon, Capricorn, trust that people will enjoy listening to you. Words come effortlessly to you, and you exude confidence. You willingly accept the compliments of others. Your energy level is high and you will be unstoppable. This is only fair after all of the work you've put in these last few months!
 ----- 
 Here is just the kind of day artists dream about, Aquarius. After yet another lukewarm reception of your artwork, an influential agent shows up and offers to place your paintings in one of the most prestigious museums in the world! This is just an example of the kind of extraordinary event that could be in store for you today. Whatever your pursuits, you have a very good chance of success!
 ----- 
 You could be in the spotlight in the next few days, Pisces. Try to resist succumbing to the applause of the audience, as you may encounter some unexpected obstacles. After being recognized by the public, you may need to confront the question, "Now what?" The answer lies in taking a modest approach from the outset.
 ----- 
 It may be difficult to stay grounded today with all the information flying around and all the emotion roiling in your heart. Try not to take things too seriously, Aries. This is the key to maintaining a level head today. Approach the day with passion and take care of any investigative work that needs doing. There are important facts coming from unexpected sources.
 ----- 
 You may be pushed around by two very powerful camps today, Taurus. Since you're the kind, diplomatic, and sensitive type, you make the perfect target for the more abrasive and opinionated. You may want to side with the cold, hard facts presented to you, although there is a great deal of emotional power working to stir up the pot. Things may not be as clear as they seem at first glance.
 ----- 
 You're apt to feel a bit wilder today, Gemini. There's a wave of powerful energy working to strengthen your ego and self
 ----- 
 A good tactic today would be to convert your fears to motivation for positive action. You have a great deal of energy at your disposal, Cancer. Don't waste it. Be aware that it's one of those situations when the smallest comment or insult may set off a chain reaction of misinformation. People are emotionally charged, so be careful where you step.
 ----- 
 You're likely to be faced with conflicting reports today, Leo. Information may be tainted with emotion, so be careful about going with the choice that shouts the loudest. You may get pigeonholed into a place you don't want to be in. Heed the internal warnings you pick up. This is a good day to work and play with passion. Take care of any investigative work that needs to be done.
 ----- 
 You may be seduced by fantastic promises that offer wonderful rewards. Beware of lots of bells and whistles, Virgo. There may be a great deal of talk but not much to substantiate such wonderful claims. Don't be surprised if people with intense emotions are stepping up to add their opinions about how you should run your life. Don't forget who's boss.
 ----- 
 People are apt to be quite emotional when it comes to the image they wish to project today, Libra. Be careful where you step. It's your job to see through the trendy makeup and fashion that hide the true personalities of the people who insist on wearing these masks. The key is to not be fooled by those who hide behind a facade built by society.
 ----- 
 Scorpio, don't be surprised if some of your fantasies and dreams are put on trial by a harsh force that cuts right to the truth of the matter. People may be extra passionate, and most aren't going to be impressed with unrealistic plans. You can try your normal approach of simply ramming straight ahead with your plans, but a better approach might be to think first and be more strategic.
 ----- 
 You're at an emotionally climactic point now, Sagittarius, and you might find that harsh opposition is coming at you for no clear reason. There's a stubborn, strong force surrounding you, and you should be aware that the more rigid your viewpoint, the harder it will be for any resolution. Compromise is an essential element of the day.
 ----- 
 Be careful to not be too cavalier today, Capricorn. It would be wise to adopt a more serious tone than usual. You might be inclined to say words carelessly, but people are going to take you literally. Make sure you mean what you say. Your attention to fashion and pop culture may conflict with a force that's asking you to focus on things of deeper spiritual value.
 ----- 
 You have the sensitivity to pick up on what's going on in every situation today, Aquarius. Powerful emotions may conflict with extremely strong opinions. Welcome to the battle between the head and the heart! On this day you may be more apt to side with the heart. Realize that this arena is heated and that the forces around you are extremely stubborn.
 ----- 
 The fantasy world that you've built for yourself is a pleasure, Pisces. People frolic in it and have a grand time. Your presence delights people. Today, however, this world may be threatened by harsh realities that are coming in the form of electronic information. This force is powerful and apt to be erratic and spontaneous. Be prepared to stand your ground.
 ----- 
 Social events or group activities could put you in touch with a lot of people, Aries, both close friends and casual acquaintances. A new person may come into your life who makes a difference for you. Issues may come up that you feel strongly about, and you aren't likely to hesitate about expressing your opinions. This is fine, as you will be tactful and others will appreciate your sincerity.
 ----- 
 Taurus, you should feel physically strong and energetic today and ready to take on just about anything that comes your way. This is good, as you may be presented with some powerful challenges that bring new purpose to your life. Excitement and enthusiasm permeate your entire being right now. Anything that comes your way you're likely to face with determination, undeterred by the enormity of the task.
 ----- 
 Spiritual passion is tempered by romantic desire today, Gemini, and you're likely to want to pursue both. Perhaps your romantic partner is as spiritually inclined as you, and you both aspire to the same ends. Much of the passion you feel wells up from deep within. If you're in any way creatively inclined, you may want to memorialize these feelings through writing, painting, or music.
 ----- 
 If you're currently romantically involved, Cancer, you can expect your relationship to move to the next level of commitment. You and your partner could agree to be monogamous, get engaged, or set a wedding date. If you're married, you might decide to have a child. If you aren't involved, expect to attract someone soon. You're ready, and eligible partners are definitely registering your availability!
 ----- 
 An invitation to an important social event could come today, Leo. This could represent a chance to meet important people who could advance your career or who might be involved in a field that interests you. Your energy and enthusiasm won't be lost on these people, or anyone for that matter, as you will obviously be speaking from the heart when you discuss what's on your mind.
 ----- 
 A previously untapped talent could emerge today, Virgo. You may decide to train this talent and foster a skill that can help you with any type of work you will do. This is definitely the day for it, as you should be full of energy and enthusiasm, capable of assuming any task, however formidable. Physically, you should feel strong and well. This is a day full of challenges and new enterprises.
 ----- 
 Romantic passion might motivate you to work on improving your appearance, Libra. You might decide to exercise, change your diet, and experiment with new clothing styles. You're likely to produce the results you want. With the energy and enthusiasm churning within you today, you might surprise yourself with this task or anything else you do.
 ----- 
 You'll wake up ready to take on the world, Scorpio. Excitement, enthusiasm, and purpose will fill your soul, yet you might wonder where it comes from, as nothing has changed since yesterday. Don't waste time mulling over it 
 ----- 
 Information gleaned from friends could have you focusing on a new goal, Sagittarius. You may have a lot of ideas about projects you want to take care of, and today you might realize which one has top priority. Start moving! Whatever you choose to do, find out what you need before you start. There's a chance that you might waste time running around trying to find necessary materials.
 ----- 
 The Universe is inviting you magnify your vision, Capricorn. It's time to see the bigger, better, more advanced side of things. Remember that life is a mirror. You're highly unlikely to receive more than you hope for. So dream big, hope big, and imagine yourself in the stars. Don't sell yourself short. It's a misuse of humility and modesty.
 ----- 
 You should feel especially emotional today, Aquarius, reacting strongly to nearly everything you see, whether a photo of a natural disaster, a group of children, or a kitten sitting on a doorstep. Spiritually, you're highly motivated and longing to know more about worlds beyond this one. You might long to make a pilgrimage, perhaps to a holy shrine or other sacred place. If you're serious, make plans.
 ----- 
 Dreams and visions might come and go today, Pisces, as unconscious drives and images surface. Some of these impressions could represent old traumas or phobias that need to be released. You could also draw creative inspiration from these perceptions and use them as a basis for artistic projects. By day's end you may feel much lighter 
 ----- 
 Tasks of any kind are likely to seem like the labors of Hercules today, Aries. Overwork and strain could have you feeling a little under the weather. It might be a good idea to take some time alone to rest. If you can't, at least try to take things easy. Also, some unexpected changes in your community might have tongues wagging. Be sure to check out the facts before jumping to conclusions.
 ----- 
 Money matters might be weighing on the mind of a close friend or lover, Taurus, and he or she might seek your advice. A creative project may require a larger expenditure of money, time, or other resources than you originally thought. This could make you wonder if you will be able to continue with it. It might take some tweaking on your part, but you should be able to complete it as planned.
 ----- 
 You might have visitors, Gemini, or even a hot date scheduled for tonight. By midafternoon you might feel too tired to go out and wonder if you should cancel. It's best to keep your activities low
 ----- 
 Deliveries that you expect could be delayed, Cancer. Today you might learn something shocking about a neighbor or relative. The gossip might spread rapidly through your community. This could have you reeling even though it might be exaggerated. You might visit a few people nearby or spend a lot of time on the phone trying to learn the truth. Don't take anything you hear at face value.
 ----- 
 Some good but surprising news could come your way today, Leo. Perhaps a family member or friend will call or drop by with a surprising development that directly affects you. In the evening, go out together and celebrate. Don't forget to include your special someone in your celebration plans.
 ----- 
 Today may start out frustrating, Virgo. Be prepared! Some equipment might go on the blink and it could take a while to get it fixed. A temporary separation from your partner could also be disappointing. You may have a lot of physical energy for which you have little immediate outlet. Take a long walk. This would not only provide an energy outlet but also clear your head.
 ----- 
 Your level of artistic inspiration is high today, Libra. Dreams or meditation may bring up some spiritual insights and revelations, and you may promptly forget them upon coming out of your dream or meditative state. This could prove frustrating! Try writing them down even if you only remember snatches. This can help bring them to the surface again. You will want a record of them anyway.
 ----- 
 Some upsetting news regarding money could throw you into a dither today, Scorpio. Perhaps a check you've been expecting hasn't arrived on time. Maybe the bank has made an error regarding your account. It isn't anything that can't be straightened out, though it's going to be a pain making all the calls. Basically, all should be going very well for you. This is only a temporary setback.
 ----- 
 A setback in your career might have you feeling disoriented, Sagittarius. Equipment might be involved. Don't go crazy. It's only temporary. Your determination, efficiency, and practicality should take care of it in no time. Basically, you're probably feeling optimistic about the future and unlikely to change that energy any time soon. Try not to worry about problems today. Spend time relaxing and enjoying the company of friends and family.
 ----- 
 A delivery that you were expecting from far away might be delayed, Capricorn, causing you to wonder if it might have been lost. It hasn't. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do but wait. Mechanical equipment could also go out of whack, necessitating a call to a repair service. This could set you back some and make you antsy. Try to find something else to do!
 ----- 
 Today you may feel especially passionate, Aquarius, and desire a romantic encounter. You might even have a hot date scheduled. Don't be surprised if it has to be postponed for reasons beyond anyone's control. You might try to sublimate those feelings through creative activities. Romantic novels and movies could also prove good outlets, though never as good as the real thing!
 ----- 
 A visitor with a few problems might come to your door in search of advice and sympathy, Pisces. He or she might also have some other news that could shock you. A professional crisis might make it necessary for you or your partner to spend most of the day away from home and family. This could be frustrating, particularly if you have to cancel plans. Hang in there!
 ----- 
 After the emotional havoc you went through over the last few weeks, the period beginning today will be quite soothing. You can take advantage of these smoother, calmer waters to rediscover emotional harmony and improve the balance of your energy flow. Moreover, Aries, if your physical health isn't quite adequate, the weeks ahead should give you a chance to rest and recuperate.
 ----- 
 The celestial configuration is speaking of a new period in which you focus on the way you differentiate yourself from others, Taurus. Are you aware of the aspects that make you unique? If not, meditate on the subject or ask close friends for input. The upcoming weeks are going to teach you a lot about this subject!
 ----- 
 This is the beginning of a new cycle, Gemini. There will be new issues cropping up over the next several days. You may have to rethink certain principles that you've adhered to in your relationships up until now. Upon reflection, you find that you no longer agree with them. It seems that the conventions and social graces required by society are weighing you down.
 ----- 
 This is a pleasant day, Cancer. Indeed, the celestial aspects are predicting that it will be rather radiant, though likely less intense than the past week or so. You probably had some new perspectives to set up in your professional life, and now you will have to get to work setting goals! You were waiting for just this moment? Perfect!
 ----- 
 Are you ready, Leo? Are you in shape for what's going to happen? The celestial aspects are heralding a new cycle that will be filled to the brim with activities, new people, and new professional perspectives. Let's hope that you've been able to rest up lately. If you haven't, try to schedule in some afternoon naps!
 ----- 
 Will there be change in you during the next few weeks, Virgo? This is always the question that one asks with this changing planetary environment. It's appealing to think that you may be traveling to exotic locations or perhaps changing jobs and meeting some interesting new people. Anything is possible with these aspects. Enjoy the renewed atmosphere!
 ----- 
 A new wind is blowing in your relationships, Libra, and you probably won't be too sorry about it! The planets are lining up to signal new beginnings. You will be able to take advantage of your recent reflections and test your new self
 ----- 
 You will be happy to know that today contains the seeds of change for your love life, Scorpio. Beginning today and for the next month or so, you're likely to be amazed by the turn of events in your relationships with others. The plot thickens as new people and groups emerge on your horizon. The aspect ahead is much less individualistic than usual.
 ----- 
 Last month you may have been somewhat more extroverted and sociable than usual, especially regarding your emotional relationships. But beginning today, your attitude will undergo a change, Sagittarius. You will probably be calmer and more reasonable. Your thoughts may begin to focus more on the future than the present. You have about a month to firm up your plans.
 ----- 
 As a person who loves to experiment with new ideas and discover new people, you will be delighted with the period that is now beginning. Since communication, togetherness, and sociability will rule the next few weeks, it will be a perfect time to get out and show off your gifts. You will have a ball, Capricorn!
 ----- 
 Today's overall outlook is positive for you, Aquarius. You can expect to focus on giving a little more character, expression, or enrichment to your domestic life. You may redecorate a part of the house or find new leisure activities for the children. Don't be reluctant to suggest something original. They will probably enjoy it!
 ----- 
 You're embarking on a phase devoted in large part to your love life, Pisces! Make this time completely fulfilling by introducing fresh new ideas. Don't let these pleasures grow stale. The cycle ahead is extremely auspicious for romance. It's a good time to take a trip, just the two of you. If you're single, you may meet an uncommonly interesting new person.
 ----- 
 Aries, you can expect the day to be a bit bumpy. If you were an Olympic athlete, today you'd be standing at the starting line, wondering if you had trained enough for a topnotch performance. Have you had enough practice? Will you make the grade? Issues related to your material resources will certainly be on the agenda.
 ----- 
 A planetary configuration like today's often makes people afraid to start anything that challenges the status quo. This is true for you in your professional life. You should dare to take on more responsibility. The aspects speak of fear only, not of being incapable of succeeding. The saying about fear being the only thing to fear is something you should take to heart right now, Taurus.
 ----- 
 Gemini, today's your chance to stand up to family members who want to exert too much control over your love life. It's time to bang your fist on the table and say, "Enough's enough, I'll love who I want to." When you insist that well
 ----- 
 It's up to you to strut your stuff, Cancer. As long as you're bashful about showcasing your innate gifts, it will be difficult to find meaning in your life. Today's planetary alignment gives you the challenge to take your talents more seriously. You could easily profit from them, provided you look deep inside to discover how.
 ----- 
 You don't have to answer to society's cultural values, Leo. If most of your work is organized around an activity that's considered fashionable, you will never succeed in feeling good about yourself or your creations. You're too motivated by meaningful activities to spend your time with frivolous ones. Today's aspects will push you to cut yourself off from all that doesn't resonate deeply.
 ----- 
 You may have noticed for some time now to what an extent your ambitions wear you out and to what point they have become outdated. If you aspire to live an ambitious life, but also one that is calmer and more balanced, the celestial energy is indicating the moment has come to make some important decisions, Virgo.
 ----- 
 Are you hesitating, Libra? Do you feel caught between the desire to participate fully in the world and the equally strong desire to remain in your dream world, even at the risk of feeling a little out of it? Who says that these two worlds are incompatible? If you look closely, you will see that you don't need to choose one or the other.
 ----- 
 You can expect to have to make a choice today related to your intimate relationships. You may have become aware that something is missing, either in your partner or yourself. Today you will act on that awareness, but it may not be easy. The root of the problem could be an issue of independence and self
 ----- 
 You're being called upon to make a commitment or promise, most likely relating to your love life. Will you take that decisive step? That's the question today. Over the next few days you will doubtless have to prove what you're made of. The challenge most likely emanates from your romantic relationships. There is no running away this time, Sagittarius. It's time to take a stand.
 ----- 
 There are times in your love life when you may feel somewhat inhibited, as though something is holding you back from total fulfillment. Perhaps the emotions overwhelm you or the idea of commitment frightens you. In any case, Capricorn, you're well aware that your reluctance to take the plunge is detrimental to your relationship. The day will call on you to take a few more risks.
 ----- 
 The forecast today is stormy. You may have sensed that there was some tension clouding the conversation at home. Resentments were left unsaid and subtle power games were played without resolution. Today, Aquarius, it all becomes too unbearable for you. Regardless of the risks involved, you will take measures to clear things up.
 ----- 
 The day is likely to be somewhat challenging, and it contains some disappointments. You're liable to feel dejected if you receive a lackluster response from the world. Apparently, Pisces, your performance has lost some of its ability to captivate an audience. Whether you accept this or try to shine up your act is the question of the day!
 ----- 
 If you were in charge of a company's human resources department, Aries, today you would begin to completely overhaul the recruitment procedure. You would focus more on the human element rather than any diplomas and awards people wave around as evidence of their abilities. Confidence in people combined with trust in your instincts could prove profitable in more ways than you imagine.
 ----- 
 Taurus, the romantic side of your life may be rocked by a storm of emotion. You may go from intense rage to ecstasy in an instant. The day may instruct you to get hold of your emotions. If you hope to build a stable relationship, it's necessary to maintain psychological coherence and physical health.
 ----- 
 The day may be somewhat oppressive, Gemini. It's possible you will receive some unpleasant news related to your domestic life. Perhaps in the past few years you haven't been especially careful about your home budget. Or you may have postponed an important maintenance task for too long. While this may not be the day the roof literally falls in, it's time to take care of repairs.
 ----- 
 You seem frustrated today, Cancer! There's only one person who could possibly arouse your anger to such a degree, and that's you. Today's aspect is favorable for crises of conscience that result in a change of attitude. You're likely to remember to choose your words more carefully from now on.
 ----- 
 This is a contemplative day, Leo. You seem to be developing new techniques, means, therapies, and methods to use in your main occupation. Today you're likely to question your underlying reasons for so much innovation. Why reinvent the world? Although you may not make any major changes in your activities, you could find new justifications for them.
 ----- 
 You will have to expect the day to be somewhat frustrating, Virgo. Your friends may insist that you be more cooperative and less individualistic. They could resent your refusal to be part of the team. In fact, your rebelliousness may be earning you quite a reputation! How you deal with these clashes will set the stage for your future. Think carefully before taking action.
 ----- 
 You mustn't expect to do whatever you like today, Libra. Quite the contrary! You may be restrained by technical limitations. Perhaps your financial resources will be insufficient. In other words, you won't be able to follow your usual pattern of taking refuge on a spiritual island and quietly contemplating your inner thoughts.
 ----- 
 Science, space exploration, and certain other fields require the participation of all with a very strong team spirit. Stubborn as you are, it doesn't make you the greatest specialist in group dynamics. Certainly no one would ever accuse you of enjoying working in a group, unless you're the one in charge. Just such a miracle is possible, Scorpio, provided you take the first step.
 ----- 
 What good does it do you to resist change, Sagittarius? Everyone knows that you have trouble adapting to change in the world around you. Unfortunately, that's life and you can't do much about it. However, you aren't powerless. You will find that life is more stable when you can surf the waves of change. Embrace change and make it work for you rather than resist it all the time.
 ----- 
 If you work in a helping profession such as psychotherapy, you're probably breaking quite a few rules and protocols right now, Capricorn. You may even be going against theories that were a fundamental part of your education. Don't be troubled by your rebelliousness. It's important that the status quo be challenged from time to time. It's people like you who advance the field!
 ----- 
 You don't have to be a genius or do something extraordinary in order for people to notice you, Aquarius. It's time you abandon the notion that you can't play a musical instrument because you don't have perfect pitch or that you can't sculpt because you don't have Michelangelo's genius! Dare to engage in any hobby or interest that you fancy.
 ----- 
 You aren't free enough, Pisces. This is especially true in your relationships. With the current astral energy, you can expect to break free of your chains. It's time for you to participate more in life. Speak your mind. Tell people what you want and when you want it. Surely one of your desires is freedom. Overcome your fear of rejection and ask for it! It really is as simple as that.
 ----- 
 Today you might feel a little under the weather due to physical and emotional stress over the past few days. Take it easy today if you can. This isn't the day to be too busy or start new projects. Miscommunication could cause an upset or two, Aries, so try to maintain your cool. Don't make mountains out of molehills. Nothing will come up that can't be handled.
 ----- 
 Disturbing dreams or unsettling moods could arise today, causing you to wonder if something is wrong or something bad is going to happen. Let it go, Taurus. If anything goes wrong, it isn't likely to be anything major. A recent event may have triggered old impressions that are causing these feelings. You could also be picking up on others' moods, as your intuition is high.
 ----- 
 Disconcerting developments in the lives of family members could cause some stress at home. There could be some problems with the structure of the house itself. Perhaps the plumbing or electricity needs attention. If a family member is upset, Gemini, keep the lines of communication open. If there are problems that need attention, get them out of the way now.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if many visitors come to your door today. A relative or co
 ----- 
 Low biorhythms could have you feeling a little depressed. You may tend to doubt your goals and abilities. Don't let this send you into a fit of gloom, Leo. All is better than it seems. Realize that today you're likely to blow every little setback out of proportion. Give everything you try your very best effort. Go out tonight and have a good time!
 ----- 
 Communication with friends or family may not come easily today, Virgo. An unusual level of inhibition could keep you from reaching out to others. You might try to shake this off by working too hard, even if you aren't sure exactly what you want to do. This is a good day to read, study, or work on projects in solitude. A long walk during the day could clear your head and reignite your enthusiasm.
 ----- 
 Your intuition is likely to be operating at a very high level today, Libra. This isn't a good day to be around sick or depressed people. You will probably pick up their gloom and it could possibly spoil your day. This is a good day to finish old projects that you may have postponed. Your insights and ingenuity are likelier than usual to give you the motivation you need.
 ----- 
 Fear about your financial security could plague you today, Scorpio. Dissatisfaction with some of work you've been doing and delays in reaching some of your goals might have you wondering what you could do better. Doubts about a friend's motives might cause you to waver in your trust of that person. Take the time to consider everything objectively. All is probably not as it seems.
 ----- 
 Have you been wondering if you're in the right profession? Disillusionment with your field could have you feeling mildly ill from stress and considering a total career change. Perhaps this is the right course of action to take, but perhaps not. Look into the options available and see how you feel about them, Sagittarius, but wait a few days before making any final decisions.
 ----- 
 Unsettling news from far away could have you somewhat upset and a little depressed. The temptation to withdraw and brood might seem too strong to resist, but this may not be the best course of action. Getting things done is likely to be the best therapy in emotional situations like this, Capricorn. So if there's a new project you've been considering, this is the day to start it.
 ----- 
 A friend might be ill, causing you considerable worry. One of the goals you've been trying to reach could be delayed in some way, causing frustration. Your financial situation could also be on your mind. You could be worrying needlessly, Aquarius. The situation is cloudy and may not be as unsettling as it seems. You may have received some misinformation. Check the facts before making yourself crazy.
 ----- 
 Relations with colleagues could be a bit strained due to increased job stress. If you've been thinking of entering a business or romantic partnership, this isn't the day to decide. Your mind may be a bit muddled. Misunderstandings or misinformation could cause you to doubt the wisdom of the partnership. This needs to be considered objectively, Pisces. Your doubts may be groundless.
 ----- 
 Authorities who have been your guides up to now may confront you. The hour is here to set aside your fears and lead yourself along your path. This is undoubtedly a very positive state of affairs. It means that you're maturing, Aries. Besides, there's nothing to stop you from asking for help from time to time, should you need it.
 ----- 
 The day is likely to be confrontational. The latest developments in your career have offered you so little encouragement that you're tempted to cut back on your efforts, but your financial situation is forcing you to try even harder. The flashes of insight you gain today are only likely to increase your discomfort, but in the end they will provide some valuable information.
 ----- 
 You're likely to experience a day of thoughtfulness and reflection, Gemini. Your state of mind will resemble that of a person who has just rebelled against everything and is now in search of a new vehicle for self
 ----- 
 The day may give you great insight into the decisions you face concerning your future. Now is the time to decide on your priorities. Do you want a career right away or would you prefer to continue your studies? Are you satisfied with your love life and family relationships? It's possible that a major upheaval in one of these realms will affect all the others. It will be interesting!
 ----- 
 Prepare for a somewhat stressful day, Leo. Your family life may be marred by some disagreements. There's some likelihood you will feel as though your territory is being invaded and your range of action limited. But you have no intention of surrendering. You've a right to a room of your own. You will fight for it tooth and nail!
 ----- 
 You may have planned to isolate yourself in order to get things done, but that won't be possible. It's like a force is destabilizing your professional life. Nothing seems to go right today. Everyone may be disagreeing, misunderstandings may crop up, things could be delayed, and communications are likely to be scrambled. You will be asked to take sides in a conflict, Virgo. Try to stay neutral.
 ----- 
 People seem fussy about your way of doing things today, Libra. Try as you might, it seems there's no pleasing the authorities. You, one of the world's great escape artists, would be well advised to choose this opportunity to do a vanishing act. However, if the financial health of your home is at stake, it would be better to stay and face the music.
 ----- 
 Your characteristic independence may play some tricks on you today, Scorpio. What you say won't be approved of as easily as usual. Even though you have quite a bit of freedom, there are others who assume that you feel you don't have enough. There's no way to please everybody. This concern is their problem, not yours. Do the people you associate with daily really understand who you are?
 ----- 
 Here is a day that may make you think you aren't exactly in the right place in your profession, Sagittarius. Could it be that your current position is too traditional? You're someone who wants to expand on all the ideas that you have at any given moment. It would seem that your superiors aren't evolving in the same way. If this is the case, take the necessary action.
 ----- 
 Some past stories may come back to haunt you today, Capricorn. If you once held a government post, for example, a journalist could undercover some error that you made years ago and publish it in today's newspaper! Everyone has to deal with the jealousy of others at some point in their lives. So prepare yourself and fight back!
 ----- 
 You may be taking stock of your professional life, Aquarius. If this is so, be careful to balance strategy with personal objectives. If you're a journalist, think about writing for yourself as well as the paper. You could write novels, poetry, or plays. It doesn't matter what you create so long as it accurately reflects what you feel and is quite apart from your professional life.
 ----- 
 Something strange may happen today. Someone in your family may reproach you for having chosen your profession. It may be that your career has little connection with what people have traditionally done in your family. But just because a tradition is lost doesn't mean that it must be mourned, Pisces. Listen to your heart. If you've chosen a profession that you're truly meant for, you will know it.
 ----- 
 You may feel more of an urge than ever to search for your family roots. Your search could be so deep and intense that you may even go beyond genealogy and study archeology as a way to learn how to bring some cohesion to the odd bits and pieces of family remnants that you uncover.
 ----- 
 Today you may be impressed by the powers of concentration and self
 ----- 
 Confidence and efficiency are the day's themes. Do you long to bring your romantic involvement to the next level? Do you wish your partner would consent to a more profound commitment? You can take advantage of the energy from today's aspects to give your future a gentle nudge in the right direction, Gemini.
 ----- 
 The relative tranquillity you enjoy today lets you listen more attentively to your inner self. You're well aware of the toll you pay when you try to ignore those nudges of intuition you sometimes feel. If you're alone at some point today, Cancer, take advantage of the time to evaluate the events of the past few days. You may gain some insight into what's troubling you.
 ----- 
 You can look forward to an enjoyable day, Leo. Neither family matters nor career issues will cloud your spirit, as everything seems to be proceeding smoothly and according to plan. Moreover, the day's aspects seem to be inviting you to be a little more adventurous than usual. Any artistic or romantic undertaking will be especially fulfilling.
 ----- 
 There's no doubt that today will be excellent, Virgo. You can find satisfaction that puts a smile on your face and boosts your morale. There's the likelihood that you're challenging some of your core values. While it's true that these values have stabilized your life, you may be starting to feel they're less relevant. Approval from loved ones gives you the assurance that anything is possible.
 ----- 
 The forecast is wonderful today, Libra. You may have been asking yourself a thousand questions about what will become of you, especially in terms of your career. It's as though all your experience so far no longer make sense. The positive aspect of that observation will energize you today. Live for the moment, be in the present, and know that anything is possible in the future.
 ----- 
 Admit it, Scorpio. You have a tendency to run away from conflict in relationships. This can get you into some complicated situations. You don't always dare say what you think, and this can block your energy and determination. Try to stop yourself from running away today. Take responsibility for your opinions. Don't be afraid to voice them.
 ----- 
 Do you feel that your power has increased, Sagittarius? You may not know what to do with this newfound strength. Try looking at how you relate to your friends. Could you improve your relationships? Using power is something that one learns over time. If you let it stagnate, it will create some stubborn obstacles. "Use it or lose it" applies in this instance.
 ----- 
 You may feel that your current relationships are more complicated than ever, Capricorn. This is because you're going through a period when many planets are trying to shed light on your hidden motivations. When you're finished analyzing and have an understanding of what really drives you, your relationships will seem much simpler.
 ----- 
 You finally understand that the force of your will can't always determine everything, Aquarius. Your ego is taking a beating, no doubt, but this will help you mature. You accept being wrong and willingly revise your judgment when necessary. In a way, you've just finished your first year at a university for wisdom!
 ----- 
 You're currently stuck between two strong desires 
 ----- 
 Excessive food and drink could have you feeling rather sluggish and indifferent to everything. This can get in the way of your usual kindness and affection, but it shouldn't. Get some rest, take a stomach remedy, and get back to your old self! You might also be tempted to overspend at some point. Think about it first!
 ----- 
 Today a number of chores around the home could have you feeling overwhelmed, Taurus. Family members might abandon you, leaving you disgruntled. Do the most pressing and leave the rest for when they're home! There might be a difference of opinion between you and your mate. Try to see both sides of the issue and circumvent any serious disagreements.
 ----- 
 Some minor but annoying communications could interrupt your routine today. You won't appreciate the distraction, Gemini, but it's best to take care of whatever it is and then go back to your tasks. You might have to spend part of the day running errands. Traffic might have you frazzled. Spend the evening relaxing at home. You've worked hard and you deserve it!
 ----- 
 Boredom and apathy could tempt you to run to the mall and spend a lot of money on luxuries. You might overindulge in food and drink. This can make you feel better temporarily, Cancer, but in the end all you will have is an empty wallet and a stomachache. Treat yourself, but don't throw caution to the wind. This feeling will pass by tomorrow, and you don't want to regret your day!
 ----- 
 A lot of activity could take place around home today. It could involve a number of visitors, or it could simply be a lot of work that needs doing. Either way, you might feel a bit frazzled, and the temptation to run away from it all might be almost irresistible. Relax! There's no need to stress out. Just do what needs to be done and enjoy the rest of the day.
 ----- 
 News of unforeseen success could come your way today, leaving you reeling and breathless. You might feel a bit dazed, Virgo, like you don't know what to do with yourself. It might take a while to gather yourself. A lot of letters and phone calls may come your way, some routine, some congratulatory. You could write or call a number of your friends. Some errands may be necessary.
 ----- 
 Social events or group activities may prove draining today, as a lot of people might want to take advantage of your talents. Your kind, accommodating nature might cause you to try to make everyone happy, Libra, but this isn't realistic. You might stress yourself to the point of not caring what gets done. Be discriminating about what you commit to doing.
 ----- 
 Excess is the word for today, Scorpio. You may feel overly optimistic and enthusiastic about everything, and you could throw yourself into it all a bit too eagerly. You could take on more than you can handle. There is the danger of tiring yourself out physically. You could also go the other way and become very lazy, not wanting to do much of anything. Remember, moderation is the best approach.
 ----- 
 Today you might feel a little depressed and apathetic, like you don't care what happens right now. You might try to get your mind off those feelings by spending money. This works, Sagittarius, but don't spend any more than you have to. These feelings really have more to do with the past than the present. If old pain wells up, let it go. Tomorrow all will seem a lot better!
 ----- 
 Today you might be with friends who want to go out on the town and spend money. Shopping, eating in fancy restaurants, or going to dance clubs could be in their plans. This is fine, Capricorn, as long as you don't get caught up in the excess. Find a happy medium between spending too much and acting like a party pooper.
 ----- 
 Pressure and worries involving home and family could get in the way of your concentration today, Aquarius. There may have been a quarrel with a household member that weighs on your mind. The best way to deal with this is to give yourself and everyone else time to cool down. Later you're likely to find that it has all blown over.
 ----- 
 Organizing your office and paying bills are likely to be on your agenda today, Pisces. You could feel overwhelmed by the tasks, and you might be tempted to put them off. It's better to take it slowly until you get everything done. You don't have to do them all at once. This should lessen the stress. Spend a quiet evening at home.
 ----- 
 You may be called upon to host a gathering in your own home, Aries. At first this could throw you into a panic because you don't think your house is clean enough. Don't worry. It's probably impeccable. You're the only one who will notice any dust, so don't sweat it.
 ----- 
 You feel confident. People can't help but notice as you radiate a loving, peaceful calm, Taurus. Eyes will turn your way, and complete strangers may come up to you and tell you how attractive you are. Be confident yet humble and you will inspire people just by your peaceful, glowing presence. Take advantage of this wonderful day by enjoying yourself for the beautiful person you are.
 ----- 
 You may be running into obstacles associated with your goals. You may feel you aren't getting the support and cooperation you deserve. Today you may sense that people are emotionally distant, with shallow views on certain issues. People you expected to be on your side may turn against you, making you feel betrayed. Try not to take things personally.
 ----- 
 This is a great day for you, Cancer. Unexpected reunions are possible, thanks to the lighthearted aura you radiate. You don't need to work very hard to bring everything your way. Your sunny personality attracts the fun and good fortune that you most certainly deserve. People are extremely lucky to be in your glowing presence on a day like this.
 ----- 
 You may wonder why all the attention isn't focused on you, Leo. Perhaps you feel cheated and irritable. The more annoyed you get, the more you will drive others away instead of draw them to you. Rather than get upset or angry because attention isn't coming your way, join with the prevailing happy
 ----- 
 This is a climactic time for you, Virgo. You may feel like many difficult issues are coming to a head. You may lash out and snap at people who don't deserve it. Your actions may make the issue even more difficult to deal with. The key today is to bring more balance into your life. By controlling and stabilizing your feelings, you can deal with the difficult issues that arise.
 ----- 
 Get into the spotlight where you belong instead of letting someone else take credit for something you did, Libra. Don't be shy about strutting your stuff. You may usually turn away from people who act this way because they seem shallow and self
 ----- 
 Today can be a wonderfully productive day for you, Scorpio, if you learn how to compromise. If you insist on doing things your way only, you will run into difficult emotional conflicts. Realize that this can easily be avoided by joining hands with your partner and working together toward a common goal. There's a great deal of energy here, so don't waste it on something insignificant.
 ----- 
 You will most likely be hungry for attention today, Sagittarius. You will look at others who are on center stage and adjust your appearance or attitude in order to be more like them. Be careful of getting obsessed with attention. The key is to be yourself and happy, regardless of who's watching. A flower unseen blooms just as beautifully and smells just as sweet.
 ----- 
 This is a great day to strut your stuff, Capricorn. You're on top of the world, so enjoy it, your family, and the people around you. You're at the forefront of the action and you don't miss a beat, regardless of the conversation buzzing around you. You're able to whip out facts and dates at the drop of a hat. Don't let anyone bring you down or talk you out of your good mood.
 ----- 
 You may feel tense, Aquarius, perhaps because someone close to you disregards the way you feel. You feel as if this person is more concerned with his or her own issues and not concerned about you. Meanwhile, your sensitive, caring heart is well aware of everyone else. You support others and are thoughtful. It's time to rearrange your priorities. First care about yourself, then others.
 ----- 
 Take extra time to tend to your appearance and show off a bit today, Pisces. Keep your shoulders back and head high. Be the proud person you are. You should feel validated. Your job today is to simply uplift people with your presence. This is no sweat for you. Happiness is right up your alley, so have fun.
 ----- 
 Try not to get too caught up in any potential conflicts brewing around you, Aries. Your job lies in calming things down and bringing a more practical perspective to the situation. If you get tangled in the action phase of endeavors without first thinking about what it is that you're doing, you may confuse things more. Step back from the fire instead of throwing yourself into it headfirst.
 ----- 
 This is a great time to move forward on a writing project, Taurus. Any large, long
 ----- 
 This is an expansive time for you. You can make great progress on your goals, Gemini. The key is to clear up any miscommunication or dishonesty before you move forward with a clear conscious. Don't even bother trying to make progress before you've cleared up past cobwebs. Keeping everything on a light, flexible track will help you work more efficiently.
 ----- 
 Your engine is revved and ready, Cancer. You have a full tank of gas. Unfortunately, you may feel like there's a large obstacle in your way. Perhaps this obstacle is your mental attitude and inability to make confident decisions. You may become so scattered at times that you can't effectively move forward on anything. Don't beat yourself up over it. The answers will come when you need them.
 ----- 
 No one likes rejection, but no one likes rejection less than you, Leo. You may hesitate to take risks in the unknown. Keep in mind that by playing it safe, you deprive yourself of the very adventure that could turn your life around. There's an energetic, expansive feeling in the air encouraging you to take that leap of faith. This energy may feel foreign to you, but it's time to embrace it.
 ----- 
 Be flexible in your communication, Virgo, and doors will open to you that you didn't even know were there. There's a tremendous amount of physical energy at your disposal. Don't waste it. By being rigid about your ways and insisting on doing things only according to your philosophy, you deprive yourself of the spontaneous adventures that give life the spice and variety you love.
 ----- 
 You may be in a difficult position, Libra. You want to explode into a new way of life yet feel stuck. Perhaps you feel chained to your current routine. You may feel like you're indeed making progress in the world, but you long for a giant release 
 ----- 
 You're getting support for and confidence from one aspect of your life and physical energy from another. Even though the two areas may be in a point of conflict, Scorpio, you have the ability to take the positive aspects from each and fuse them together to create something new or solve a problem. Pool your resources and shift into high gear. The sky's the limit.
 ----- 
 Success will come to you when you work with the energies at hand. Go with the flow of the situation instead of trying to undermine or manipulate it. There's a tremendous force at work. Perhaps all it needs is a bit of direction to align it with your goals. State your intentions openly instead of working behind the scenes. You will receive support from others when you do.
 ----- 
 You may end up in some arguments, Capricorn. Your nature is expansive and generous, but if others take advantage of this good nature, your mood quickly turns to anger and detachment. Conflict is often a natural part of a relationship. Use it as a learning experience instead of blowing it out of proportion and turning it into a larger issue than it needs to be.
 ----- 
 You may be confused about asking for help, Aquarius. Your usual resources could be occupied with issues and conflicts that have nothing to do with you. You may then offer to help others. By doing this, you've put someone else's needs above your own. Although this may feel good to you on some level, it's also a way to avoid the problems that you need to deal with.
 ----- 
 You're in the middle of a terrific yearly transition. You have a great deal of physical energy, Pisces. You have an action
 ----- 
 You may feel nostalgic as you look through photo albums, rearrange furniture, and remember past times, Aries. Your mind will touch on emotional events that you may not have fully dealt with at the time they happened. Old feelings that you thought were gone could well up and bring tears to your eyes. Honestly face these feelings now instead of stuffing them back down for another decade.
 ----- 
 You could be operating based on an assumption that's only a partial representation of the truth. In your effort to think about only the good side of the situation, Taurus, you may not see the entire truth. There's a downside to everything. Feelings of anger, frustration, and even loneliness may go along with it.
 ----- 
 If you're experiencing emotional upheaval, Gemini, you may take heart in knowing that other people are going through their own emotional turmoil as well. You will know that you aren't alone in your quest for emotional stability. Share your feelings with others instead of shutting them up inside. It will help you feel better.
 ----- 
 You may feel like someone's giving you the third degree, Cancer. You sense that you're being accused of something and that you need to defend your feelings and actions. Try not to fall into this trap. Don't let self
 ----- 
 Today may be filled with "I told you so!" You could find fault with others who haven't dealt with the truth of a situation. Be careful about accusing someone of the very thing that you're guilty of, Leo. Penetrating emotions will cut to the heart of the matter, and there will be no way to escape the hole you dig for yourself. Don't criticize others when until you take an honest look at yourself.
 ----- 
 Most of the time you deal with the facts, Virgo. Facts are things you can grasp, categorize, and make rational sense of. Unfortunately, today some of your facts may be challenged by one of the things you fear most 
 ----- 
 It will be hard to deal with emotional issues that arise. A strong misleading force is feeding the illusion that things are fine when they really aren't. Stop pretending that everything is going well, Libra. The sooner you face the truth, the sooner it will stop plaguing you. Confront the deception directly.
 ----- 
 Don't automatically assume that people are going to understand your needs, Scorpio. Your emotions may be powerful today, and you could end up scaring people away instead of drawing them closer simply because you act irrationally and emotionally instead of reasonably and civilly. Be careful about targeting your frustration at the people who can help you the most.
 ----- 
 You're in a difficult position. Things aren't exactly what they seem, Sagittarius. Your emotions run the show today, and you may jump from one extreme to the other. There's a good chance that much of what you experience is based on misinformation. Don't get so caught up in the drama that you fail to recognize the truth of the situation.
 ----- 
 When faced with an emotionally intense situation, you're likely to flee, Capricorn. You'd rather change the subject to something more lighthearted. This form of escapism is doing nothing to solve the problem. In fact, by avoiding the emotional topic, you're only creating more friction than if you just approached the problem directly.
 ----- 
 With your psychic abilities, you're liable to shed some light on issues in which the truth has been unclear for quite a while, Aquarius. You can use your sensitivity to cut to the heart of the matter and expose the truth. This kind of behavior probably won't come without friction from others. You can almost guarantee that it will. Don't let it faze you. It's important to reveal the truth.
 ----- 
 Control issues in your home are apt to be of concern today, Pisces. Be careful about feeding into others' misconceptions of the situation. You're dealing with powerful, opinionated forces that aren't going to want to budge. Someone may have a warped view of the true issue at hand. Lay all the facts on the table before you start drawing any conclusions.
 ----- 
 You may have been working on projects that make you feel good over the past few weeks, Aries, particularly projects that relate to attaining more independence in your career. In the process, you've probably developed some new skills and now feel confident enough to use them. Today's one last burst of determination and inner power could complete the process and reach the goals you want.
 ----- 
 A surge of romantic passion could move you to rendezvous with a lover no matter what obstacles bar your way. Take care to notice what your partner wants! Enterprises that you may have been pursuing with business colleagues could take a giant step forward, as both you and your partners are feeling especially strong and motivated. Move forward with caution, Taurus, but move forward.
 ----- 
 Minor ailments may awaken a new determination to improve your health. You feel especially energetic today, Gemini, so you might go to the gym. Just don't overdo it. You might also be considering several changes you'd like to make in your home or workplace. Give them careful thought before moving ahead.
 ----- 
 The desire to bring important personal projects to a close might have you focusing a lot of energy on them, Cancer. You might need to run several errands before you can finish. Your energy is high, so consider playing some sports or getting a good workout at the gym. Push yourself, but not beyond your limits, Cancer. "No pain, no gain" is a fallacy!
 ----- 
 The desire for independence may have some family members thinking about breaking out on their own. Others could desire to make some extra money for their own projects. Your house could be busy today, if you're in it at all. Don't be surprised if everyone spends most of the day somewhere else.
 ----- 
 Your mind is especially acute today, Virgo. You may come up with ideas for new projects. You're feeling especially motivated and courageous. Don't be surprised if you try to achieve the impossible. Friends or groups could play a strong role in whatever you try. Move ahead cautiously, but move ahead. Don't let the day's advantages pass you by.
 ----- 
 Strong intuition concerning ways to generate extra income might pop into your head all day. Some of them may seem off the wall, but don't let that stop you. Look into the possibilities. They might not be that outrageous. This is definitely a day to move your interests forward, Libra. You have the energy and motivation to do wonders. Make the most of today!
 ----- 
 Group activities or projects you're working on with friends could prove inspiring today. Your enthusiasm is high, Scorpio, as is your energy, so you're likely to want to channel your personal power into whatever goals you have. Today you have the courage to focus on matters that others wouldn't even attempt. Move forward with caution, but go to it!
 ----- 
 A surge of inner power and intuition could have you thinking about embracing an unusual profession. Your desire for independence is strong now, Sagittarius, so you might be thinking about working on your own, perhaps in an artistic field or a service profession. You have the power to do wonders today. Be practical and move forward with caution, but follow your heart!
 ----- 
 Today you might channel one final, powerful burst of energy into completing a goal that means a great deal to you. Your courage and determination are high, and you have the ability to accomplish a lot at this time, Capricorn. If you've been considering projects that others think are impossible, this is the day to act. Move forward with caution, but go for the gold!
 ----- 
 Determination could advance career and money matters today. If you've been thinking about striking out on your own, Aquarius, this is the day to start. Some in
 ----- 
 You may desire freedom today, Pisces. Projects involving partnerships could get a strong push forward because you're feeling especially motivated to get things done. Your partners could be inspired to get the ball rolling, and all of you may feel courageous enough to try the impossible. Don't confuse courage with foolhardiness. Caution is always called for in tricky situations.
 ----- 
 Expect a lot of activity in your home today, Aries. A group, perhaps a large one, hosted by you or a family member could meet there and provoke stimulating conversations. You could get caught up in the energy, putting you in touch with a new awareness of your feelings. Tonight, expect vivid dreams of travel, strange places, or flying.
 ----- 
 The desire to meet with a romantic partner and look and feel your best could give rise to a lot of short journeys in your area. Perhaps you will want to work out, buy some new clothes, or get a haircut. This might be a good idea. Passions promise to run high today. Stimulating conversations could bring fascinating information to light.
 ----- 
 It's time to stop acting like you think others want to see you act, Gemini. The planetary configuration confirms that it's time to express yourself 
 ----- 
 Your energy is high and your stamina particularly strong today. Working out or playing sports could appeal to you now. Running or aerobics could offer valuable exercise and clear your head to allow for new ideas. You also should feel particularly passionate. If you're involved with someone, Cancer, expect a great evening. If not, don't be surprised if you get some admiring glances.
 ----- 
 A reunion with a family member who has been away or out of touch could generate some powerful emotions, Leo. Memories could come flooding back, making you both nostalgic and maybe a bit angry. Take care to curb the latter. You don't want to spoil your reunion. Take a long, objective look at the memories and try to figure out what they mean to you now. Then let them go.
 ----- 
 Today your mind is likely to be on travel, Virgo. You might have to spend a lot of time running errands in the car. You could also be planning a long vacation, perhaps one centered on a group function or seminar of some sort. Your physical energy is high, but there's still a danger of tiring yourself out. Relax at home this evening.
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to put in some extra hours on the job or take on an extra project of some sort in order to bring in a little more money. Since you're feeling strong and energetic enough to move mountains, Libra, you need to take care not to overexert yourself. Work hard and earn your money, but pace yourself. Try to get a little exercise before going to bed.
 ----- 
 Passion and determination mark today. Your energy should be high, Scorpio, and you should feel strong and powerful. This is the perfect day to give whatever goals you've been trying to accomplish that one last push toward completion. You may surprise yourself with the power and quality of your work and the positive attention your efforts receive.
 ----- 
 Your inner power and awareness should be acute today, Sagittarius. Some intense dreams and revelations could come from deep within, allowing you to release old traumas and phobias, and enabling you to move ahead with more confidence. Physical energy is high, though you may feel you need more sleep than usual. Your intuition is also sharp, enabling you to be more in touch with others. Use it!
 ----- 
 Working toward goals you share with others could bring you closer together as friends and lovers, Capricorn. The whole is definitely more than the sum of the parts. You're likely to produce better results as a group or partnership than you would have otherwise. This is an "all pull together" sort of day. Romantically, you may have an exciting, passionate encounter!
 ----- 
 Today you might face a task that seems as workable as emptying the ocean with a teacup. But with help from others, you will not only be able to handle it but also produce exceptional results. Physically, you're likely to feel full of strength and stamina, ready to move mountains. Don't be too surprised if you actually manage to budge a few!
 ----- 
 The desire to travel, perhaps to visit a close friend, may come up today, Pisces. You may put a lot of energy into exploring the possibilities. You might also want to travel to places where you can get some artistic inspiration for creative projects. Your energy and enthusiasm are high, so you should be able to accomplish this without neglecting your other chores.
 ----- 
 A delay in receiving a communication from a distant place could prove frustrating today, Aries. You may be looking forward to a vacation, but responsibilities that suddenly crop up could postpone the trip. This probably won't be necessary, but some adjustments need to be made before you can both do what you want and fulfill your responsibilities, too.
 ----- 
 Frustration could be the word for today. If you've made plans to meet a close friend or lover, Taurus, don't count on it happening. Unexpected events might force a postponement. Problems with schedules could have you playing phone tag. This also isn't a good day to work on creative or artistic projects. The results you want could prove elusive. Spend the day reading!
 ----- 
 Upsets and disappointments on the part of a family member could have the household in an uproar. Problems with household equipment could throw a monkey wrench into everyone's routine. On days like this, it's best for everyone to get out and distract themselves. Movies, sporting events, and museums can help relieve the stress.
 ----- 
 Today you may need to contact a lot of people, Cancer, but the process could be frustrating. People may not be home, messages might not be delivered, or your equipment might not work properly. Unless it's urgent, it might be better to wait until tomorrow to try to reach them. You could end up too stressed otherwise.
 ----- 
 Conflict over money could get in the way of your usual cordial relationships, Leo. Attention to the household budget is definitely needed. Unexpected events may require some immediate purchases that you hadn't planned on. They might require some scrimping, but you should be able to minimize the need if you plan carefully. Don't make yourself crazy over anything today. You will get through it!
 ----- 
 Your mother and father, or a couple you're particularly close to, could visit you today, Virgo. Plan some distractions like movies or videos, or invite some other people over. Talking with this couple alone might result in heated discussions that accomplish nothing but get everyone worked up and stressed. Whatever happens, don't let it get you down. Everyone should feel better tomorrow.
 ----- 
 This isn't a good day to go out, Libra. Traffic is probably awful. Don't trust any gossip that comes your way! It's probably passed through at least half a dozen people and retains little, if any, of the facts. Someone might be passing along rumors for their own reasons, so believe nothing you hear without checking it out.
 ----- 
 Some unusual events could cause you to feel discontented from your life and contemplate some big changes, Scorpio. Money matters might need attention and could prove frustrating. Outrageous ideas for improving your financial status could come to mind. Make a list of options, then wait a few days before making serious plans. This isn't the day to start anything new.
 ----- 
 Recent activities have suddenly made you bored with your job and the people you deal with. You may feel restless and contemplate changes to your professional life, Sagittarius. This could be appropriate now, but it might not. It's best to look at your options logically and practically. Don't be afraid to ask family and friends for their opinions.
 ----- 
 A lack of time to pursue your spiritual and intellectual interests could weigh on your mind today, Capricorn. Gloom might descend on you, as if responsibilities of the moment are too much for you. Try to be the observer. If a friend came to you for advice with your problem, what would you say? Take your own advice. You might also want to consider streamlining your activities.
 ----- 
 An unexpected setback could interfere with reaching a long
 ----- 
 Your partner's family obligations could interfere with things you wanted to do together, Pisces. Your desire to help could also get in the way of other responsibilities. The best way to handle days like today is to plan carefully. There's always a way to squeeze it all in. This may be what you have to do.
 ----- 
 If every day were like today, life would be heaven, Aries! This is potentially a wonderful time for you. You may find the answers to problems that have been bothering you for a few weeks. Keep your eyes and ears open in all conversations. You could come across the piece you've been waiting for.
 ----- 
 Taurus, you don't have to be at everyone's beck and call all the time. This is exhausting, and you lose contact with yourself. You should try to take some time out today. Take a good look at your life to see where you're going. Go for a walk or take a long bubble bath. Things will be much clearer after a relaxing day of reflection.
 ----- 
 Is it possible you're too demanding, Gemini? Today's planetary aspects may be asking you this question. You're choosy about the people you spend time with, and you have a tendency to ask them to go too far for you. Sometimes you have trouble knowing your limits where other people are concerned. You might want to think about this.
 ----- 
 Today's a day to daydream, although this may not be an activity you usually do. You may even feel as if you're on vacation. Let's just hope people don't ask you a lot of difficult questions, because your answers will be anything but clear. But you shouldn't have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders every day, Cancer.
 ----- 
 If you have someone special in your life, Leo, today is a perfect day to stop playing at being your partner's parent, as you sometimes seem to do. Reverse roles, and let other people take care of you. The world won't fall apart if you let go for a while. No matter what happens, a day like today should open your eyes.
 ----- 
 You won't be able to fix your indecisiveness, Virgo. You just need to give yourself some time. The direction your life is taking isn't clear at the moment. There are great changes going on inside you. So, even though it may sound like strange advice, don't do a thing about it! Let the situation get clearer before you act.
 ----- 
 You have a strange and wonderful day ahead, Libra. Once you've finished your work, you may want to either draw or write something that will help you remember today for a long time. You're beginning to see the results of recent changes in you, and you're looking for a way to express them. It may be difficult to find just the right words. But aren't you a natural
 ----- 
 You have a nice day in store, Scorpio. People may seem more attentive to your needs and generally very pleasant. You may not be used to this kind of treatment! You feel more outgoing and sociable than ever. You could take advantage of the day's tolerant atmosphere to meet people you may have been too afraid to introduce yourself to. They will surely have some new things to teach you.
 ----- 
 Today is a day for healing and reconciliation. You may have been feeling abused and mistreated lately by someone (or a few people) in your family over the past few weeks. You're now ready for a new start, because you were able to work things out and you've learned something from what happened. Take the time to savor the moment, and spend some time with the people you love.
 ----- 
 You may feel living your life is like crossing a desert, but fortunately, Capricorn, today brings your oasis. Take advantage of it! Some people you've met over the past few weeks could turn out to be more interesting than you originally thought. It's up to you to change those parts of your personality that have been holding you back.
 ----- 
 Certain questions about your family life aren't as cut and dried as you might think, Aquarius. This can be the case when emotions are involved. Yet more than anyone else, you need to be careful not to hurt anyone's feelings. Today something could happen that will let you control the situation while controlling your emotions.
 ----- 
 Pisces, you may have had some confused emotions about your relationship or family over the past few days. You may not have been able to fully express your worries to others. But today these emotions will find a way to come out. Look around you. There might be someone right next to you who can help with your problems.
 ----- 
 You're a helpful person, Aries, yet in your relationships, you often seem to confuse helping with parenting. You tend to do a lot of self
 ----- 
 Everyone needs to be loved, Taurus, but it shouldn't be your only objective in life. It isn't the end of the world if your charms fall flat every once in a while. Today you may be tempted to be a little less charming and seductive with the people around you. Some may even say you aren't acting like your usual self. Ignore them. A little self
 ----- 
 There are days when a little humility can be good for you, Gemini, and this might be one of those days. It's as if the planets are talking to you about sincerity and taking you far away from the trappings of superficiality and popularity. The things that are important to you today are much deeper concepts of humanity and compassion.
 ----- 
 Your fiery willpower can help you move mountains, Cancer. But you already know that. When it's combined with your legendary optimism, it's a powerful tool you just can't do without. Today you will reap the rewards for your hard work over the last month, in every aspect of your life. The fire that burns inside you and gives you your incredible determination has its limits. Don't misuse it.
 ----- 
 Today could discourage even the most ardent of passions, Leo. Even if some people say you're a bit cold, know that there's a veritable volcano burning underneath all that ice. Today you may once again find yourself at a distance from your feelings, as if you were regaining control over your emotions. Be careful about being too cynical about things.
 ----- 
 Virgo, you should try to be tolerant of other people's social and political positions. You may have to deal with certain people whose personal plans are jeopardized by events beyond their control. Don't judge them. Don't immediately defend one viewpoint without thinking how the situation affects the other person's life.
 ----- 
 This is a day for doubts, for asking those hard questions that you need to answer. If you like to meditate, Libra, think about spending a little more time at it today. You could learn a lot about yourself. You will see the whole palette of human emotion in other people, from joy to disappointment. Where do you fit in?
 ----- 
 It may seem that you've been accumulating a lot of excess nervous tension and stress, Scorpio. Unfortunately, you won't be able to count on the people around you to make it any better. What your partner wants and what you want may not coincide. It could be time to think about reenergizing your relationship. How about planning a weekend away for just the two of you?
 ----- 
 You may feel physical and emotional tension today, Sagittarius. Are you taking the time to care for your body? Has someone been putting a lot of pressure on you lately? Are you an emotionally satisfied person? The way you feel physically is a good indicator of your mental state. Try to go a little easier on yourself and you will see immediate benefits.
 ----- 
 People love to be with you because you have such natural charm, Capricorn. But today you may not feel especially charming or like talking to anyone. You may have a secret inside that's screaming to get out. If someone confides in you today, do you think you could confide in him or her, too? You should get an answer to that question today.
 ----- 
 Your partner may be all over you today, Aquarius! Are you in the mood to listen? Are you interested in some love? Probably not. You may have had a hard day and just feel like some quiet time together. You aren't up to the demands your partner may make on you. You don't need to worry about it. It happens to everyone from time to time.
 ----- 
 You're often moved by emotion, Pisces. You like situations that make you feel alive. Today your love life may give you just that kind of adventurous feeling. If that's the case, don't get so far into your emotions that it becomes too much for you. There is such a concept as too much of a good thing!
 ----- 
 You could write fiction or journalism well today. There's a good possibility that you have given some thought to a literary line of work. Why do you hesitate? It's never too late. Find the time to write a story. If you have a negative attitude about the things you do, how will you get anything done?
 ----- 
 Today is your day, Taurus! Do your best to make your mark on the people around you, especially those closest to your heart. You will outdo yourself, grabbing attention without even meaning to. You will be considered very attractive. Don't be surprised if your calendar fills up. This is your reward for all your work over the past few weeks.
 ----- 
 You have an excellent day ahead, Gemini. It's likely to open new horizons for you at a time when the future may have seemed bleak. If old issues related to your family resurfaced some time ago, they may be resolved in a surprising way today. In any case, this is an ideal opportunity to seek answers from your ancestors.
 ----- 
 Several days ago you may have experienced a strong feeling of connection. People close to you opened their hearts and expressed their hopes for the future. Today you're likely to feel new ambitions budding, Cancer, which may have been initiated by the earlier experience. The day's aspects are bound to inspire you!
 ----- 
 There are some wonderful surprises in store for you, Leo. They could come in the form of a new career opportunity or potential dates. With the current planetary aspects, you can avail yourself of the best ways to find personal and professional fulfillment. Don't hesitate to be original. That quality will trump everything else!
 ----- 
 You can look forward to a day full of satisfaction, Virgo. You may have made a strong impression on the people around you as you learned to moderate your outspokenness. Supportive friends surround you today. Everyone seems willing to listen, and they trust you implicitly. It looks as though you're finding a place for yourself!
 ----- 
 You're definitely going to appreciate the harmony today, Libra. After the confrontational mood of the past several days, it looks as though you will be able to rest a bit. If you feel somewhat weary, it's for good reason. Today provides a good opportunity to rid yourself of the burdens people are trying to make you carry.
 ----- 
 The day will come when an authority applauds you for your work or research. Only then will you understand that you've let yourself be fooled by society. Much as you believe otherwise, society isn't trying to stifle you or stop you from being you, Scorpio. It's true that pioneers often aren't recognized until they can show some results.
 ----- 
 You may feel that certain values in your profession won't let you undertake certain activities. But are you sure about this, or have you tried to convince yourself of it so you won't have to confront the part of you that yearns to explore? Perhaps you should try to be braver than you've been. It would be worth it.
 ----- 
 Here you go again, philosophizing about what personal expression, creation, and authenticity are all about. Have you noticed that you have some problems expressing issues that don't fall within the norm, Capricorn? Your strong will and desire to be appreciated get in your way. It isn't easy to express yourself authentically when you're trying to make an impression on others.
 ----- 
 Think about tolerance, Aquarius, and notice to what extent it can liberate you. If you let others do and think what they like, you will find that you grant yourself this same right. This is the issue of the day for you. It's when you don't allow cultural norms to ruffle your feathers that you can liberate yourself.
 ----- 
 Why not say yes a little more than usual, Pisces? You can be stubborn and want to do only what you want. It isn't easy to lead you into the unknown. You like to prepare in advance. Today when people make unusual propositions, why not go agree? Go on 
 ----- 
 You will have to rely on your analytical skills and steely self
 ----- 
 The astral configuration indicates that you may be interested in pursuing some kind of training, Taurus. Assess where you are in your professional life. Are you up to persuading people with your expertise? Don't think that you have to know more in order to be a good teacher. In fact, it's often by teaching that the teacher learns the subject.
 ----- 
 Do you have some drawings in a drawer, Gemini? Since last month, or possibly before, you've been thinking about your creative ability. You have a habit of turning your back on your skills, whether in drawing, photography, or writing, but they're in you nonetheless. People will expect more of you! All you have to do is take out a brush or pen and you will be on your way.
 ----- 
 One last, concerted effort and you will be able to get to the root of a problem that has been on your mind for a while now. The answer to the question concerning your identity isn't entirely to be found in your family history, Cancer. You're part of a generation as well as a family. Both influence your responses.
 ----- 
 You've been doing a lot of cleaning up and clearing out. Since this project has been going on for several years now, you must be doing a particularly thorough job. Finally, it seems as if you're getting things straight with your karma. Today will be a big day, Leo. You may be able to leave part of your childhood behind, as at last you understand that it's ancient history.
 ----- 
 Sometimes you have to go back to square one if you want a situation to get better, Virgo. This can be frustrating or even humiliating, but if the goal is to have a solid foundation on which to rebuild, it's well worth it! Don't get too attached to your professional past. You have to advance and you're too weighed down now. Let go!
 ----- 
 A moment will come when you can no longer fight against the current transformation you're going through in your professional life, Libra. The system that you live in will soon put you at a kind of impasse, but this won't necessarily be unpleasant. However, you will be obliged to change paths whether you like it or not. You will probably want to!
 ----- 
 You won't allow yourself to get sidetracked by minor things today, Scorpio. You will get straight to the heart of the matter. There's some likelihood that you haven't considered your working conditions and instead you're concentrating on the goal you've set for yourself. When you set a goal, you're a force to be reckoned with!
 ----- 
 About two weeks ago, it may have occurred to you that you should be making more of an effort to advance your career, Sagittarius. If so, it will be easier for you to accept today's constraints, as there is some probability that you will need to perform at your highest level. Be careful not to lose yourself in the attempt!
 ----- 
 Your light, breezy spirit may have some trouble harmonizing with today's prevailing mood. Usually when you're cornered, you're able to find a way to squirm to safety. Today you may run out of clever maneuvers. Even though you face the day's challenges alone and unaided, you survive them the same way. Good for you!
 ----- 
 What a day, Aquarius! Whether at work or at home, you may find yourself choosing between two options, both of which stem from anxiety! You may decide to vanquish your doubts by burying yourself in your work. If so, you can expect to expend a great deal of energy. Or you may react with indifference, and the apathy will cost you just as much. The situation will improve in a few days.
 ----- 
 It's often said that your energy feeds on strong emotions. Situations that require some daring are an excellent source of such excitement. This is the key to understanding the day ahead, Pisces. True, you can expect some hair
 ----- 
 This day may not be one of your favorites, Aries. You may be all too aware of the constraints of your chief occupation. You're likely to hanker for appropriate rewards for your labors. This is a good day to define new personal and professional goals. They will sustain you through your chores. In the meantime, how about asking for that raise?
 ----- 
 Until now, you may have been too stubborn about doing what you want without trying to address the question of your financial means, Taurus. Even if it seems too materialistic, It's urgent that you take care of this question. Push ahead and try to raise your standard of living, because you have something to learn in this domain.
 ----- 
 You could be a situation in which you have to make a decision about a relationship, Gemini. Perhaps old demons have come back to haunt you about your freedom, and now you have doubts. Don't listen to the doubts, because if you do, you may regress ten paces in your emotional life. Roll the dice and decide.
 ----- 
 You aren't the biggest advocate for working under constraints, Cancer, so today is going to be good for you. You will accept them, and gracefully. Do you understand the meaning of such a day? It would be wonderful if you learned how to hold onto the paradox you discover. The greatest freedom comes through discipline. If you can do this, you will be happy!
 ----- 
 Abandon the myth that you don't have any gifts or means at your disposal, Leo. The proof is that you have your body. Are you taking care of yourself? Do you exercise? Do you take care of minor health issues? All of these questions are related. You regard your gifts the same way you regard your body.
 ----- 
 Virgo, if you're waiting for someone to fulfill all of your needs, you may have to wait a very long time. The paradox of love is that it arrives on your doorstep in its most profound form when you need it least. So take whatever steps you must in order to fulfill yourself. If you don't, you will be eternally dependent, which doesn't suit you very well.
 ----- 
 If you have children, their difficulties may remind you of your own, Libra. Or their education brings back memories of your own. Have you held onto any issues from that period that still bother you today? This would be a good time to ask yourself that question. The answer could benefit your loved ones dramatically.
 ----- 
 Don't spend beyond your means today, Scorpio! If you happen to be in a crowd of enthusiastic shoppers, it could be disastrous for your wallet. You could yield to the prevailing spending mood all too easily! On the other hand, perhaps you owe yourself a treat. If you feel this is the case, at least limit yourself a bit.
 ----- 
 Minor tensions will arise today, Sagittarius. Someone close to you, perhaps your partner or a parental figure 
 ----- 
 The mood will be a bit oppressive today, Capricorn. After meeting the challenges presented by the past several days, you're likely to want a little peace and quiet! But you can expect to be sought out and asked to assume your duties. You may feel like forgetting the whole thing and running away. Be reasonable and wait until you have some vacation time.
 ----- 
 This isn't a day for subtle, sensitive people like you, Aquarius. In fact, the winner will probably be the one who shouts the loudest and bangs on the table. The air of aggression will have an effect on you. You could be somewhat upset and more vulnerable than usual. It would be wise for you to stay away from all the commotion.
 ----- 
 Some differences of opinion concerning your love life may come up today, Pisces. You could find your beloved taking more liberties than you allow yourself. Instead of resenting it, follow your partner's lead. This could be a chance to realize that you need more novelty in the emotional realm. Be open to looking into the possibilities. The day ahead could bring you just what you seek.
 ----- 
 Whether or not you should make a specific expenditure could cause some tension between you and a partner, Aries. You may think that it isn't feasible now, while your friend is determined to go for it. This isn't the day to try to reach an agreement in this matter. Neither of you is likely to give in. Wait a couple days until you're both a bit less tense.
 ----- 
 A friend may be throwing a party and you might be expected to attend. You've probably had a stressful day and really don't feel up to it. Your friend may try to induce you to come by making you feel guilty. Don't fall into that trap. Go only if you feel that the value of the occasion overrides your need to rest. Your friend will forgive you if you say no.
 ----- 
 Today you might receive some uncomfortable intuitive signals from one or more of your friends, Gemini. Perhaps someone doesn't feel well but came out to play anyway. Sensing the tension in others could save you some grief, as people may be stressed and likely to lash out over nothing. It's best to focus on solitary pursuits if you can.
 ----- 
 Today you may attain a goal you've been hoping to reach for a long time, Cancer. Oddly enough, friends, family, and even your significant other may not seem as happy as you expected. They've probably suffered too many frustrations recently, and your success only reminds them of this. Give them some time to settle their own affairs and they will congratulate you. They're only human.
 ----- 
 Today you may be anxious to spend time with your family, Leo, but there could be some chores you need to do first. This could stress you out quite a bit if you let it. Roll up your sleeves and handle whatever needs to be done and then hightail it back to your hEarth. Relax and enjoy the company of your loved ones!
 ----- 
 Today it might be more difficult than usual for you to deal with words, Virgo. Someone might lend you a book on a rather obscure subject that you can't understand. In fact, you might find the book 
 ----- 
 Some news that comes to you from a friend or colleague could shake you up today, Libra. You might find that what you learn casts doubts on concepts you've embraced for most of your life. This could confuse you. Don't feel threatened. Everyone has to recreate some values from time to time. Think about it when you're more relaxed and you might find it isn't so radical after all.
 ----- 
 Today you may see that nearly every couple you know is quarreling, Scorpio. You may have a few differences with a current or potential partner, but this is nothing to worry about. You're tense and edgy because of outside pressure, so your fuse might be a bit shorter than usual. Try to stretch your patience a little further, just for today. All should be well by tomorrow.
 ----- 
 Today you may be in a very stressful atmosphere. Your entourage is likely to be tense and anxious, and you're no exception. You may need to stay in the environment until you've accomplished your objectives. You will probably want to spend your evening at home in front of the TV, doing and thinking absolutely nothing. Relax!
 ----- 
 You and a current or potential partner may disagree on whether to spend some time together alone or go out with friends, Capricorn. If you've both had a rough day, you're likely to be rather tense and apt to snap at each other. A compromise may be the best answer. Spend an hour or two with your friends and then come home and relax. That way, everyone's happy.
 ----- 
 A relaxing evening at home may be just what you need, Aquarius, but a colleague might ask you to attend a business
 ----- 
 Today you may try to contact several people, Pisces, none of whom may be available. You might particularly want to reach a female friend or relative who lives far away. This could prove frustrating, as you have some interesting news for her. Keep trying. You will eventually manage to connect, and she will be glad to hear from you. She might even invite you to visit!
 ----- 
 Your energy might turn toward beautifying your home, Aries. Perhaps you've decided to repaint or go in a completely new direction in your decorating taste. Posters or other souvenirs of foreign lands might also be especially appealing now. Expect someone to drop by and bring some interesting news that might get your mind going a thousand miles an hour.
 ----- 
 A number of loving communications may come your way from people who live in distant states or exotic lands. You're feeling especially affectionate now, Taurus, particularly regarding those closest to you. It might not be a bad idea to get on the phone and talk to people you may not have seen in a long time. They will be glad to hear from you!
 ----- 
 A small amount of money might come your way today, Gemini. It could be a gift, dividend, or bonus. You may want to squander it on gifts for yourself and others rather than put it to more practical use, which is perfectly fine! Books may be especially appealing, particularly those on new spiritual or metaphysical ideas. Set some time aside for a little reading.
 ----- 
 You should feel and look great today, Cancer. Your charm and social skills are at a high level, and your joviality and gift for conversation should make you a welcome guest at any social event. And you should be invited to a lot of them 
 ----- 
 Your psychic abilities and imagination are operating at a very high level, Leo. You face other people with a profound, spiritual love. They will return it! You might want to write down your thoughts or draw pictures of whatever pops into your mind, even if you don't feel you have talent. It's more important to keep a record for you than set things down for posterity.
 ----- 
 Some friends associated with a group you admire might take you to some kind of rally, Virgo. This could be a lot of fun for you. You could make some new friends. You're naturally inclined toward humanitarian concerns, and these might be the focus of some animated discussions today. Take in all the information and consider it later. Right now your mind is overwhelmed!
 ----- 
 You're naturally a kind, compassionate person, Libra. Today your feelings are likely to be focused not only on those close to you but also on all the world's population. A feeling of unity with the billions you've never met could overwhelm you now. You might want to write down your impressions so you can refer to them later. You might otherwise forget it all.
 ----- 
 With today's planetary aspects, Scorpio, you're likely to feel a rush of love. This includes love for family, friends, partner, and all life forms. The reality of spiritual advancement through love is all around you. Your artistic sensibilities are very high, so you might want to write, draw, or paint something that captures your thoughts and feelings.
 ----- 
 You're feeling especially loving and passionate, Sagittarius, and likely to want to pursue a romantic encounter with the special person in your life. Money matters look positive, as your intuition regarding money management has been working well and is likely to continue. Your psychic and intuitive faculties are wide open and receptive. Don't be surprised by what you pick up today, even from strangers.
 ----- 
 Today is a great time to form or strengthen romantic relationships, Capricorn. If you aren't involved, chances are you will meet someone. If you are, expect your relationship to develop a new spiritual bond. New friendships, particularly with people who share your interests, are on the horizon. The coming years will be a time when everyone will have to pull together. Today you get a head start.
 ----- 
 This is an ideal day to begin a creative venture, Aquarius. You've had many ideas and creative urges. Today it's time to choose one and take the first step to making your vision a reality. You will find that the form will change. This is no reason to be discouraged. It's part of the normal evolution of any work of art. The key here is to begin.
 ----- 
 Your naturally loving nature gets a boost today, Pisces. You could look especially attractive, so don't be surprised if you draw admiring looks from strangers. Romantic novels and movies could seem appealing now, but you're more interested in the real thing. If you can, try to schedule alone time with the special person in your life. You won't regret it!
 ----- 
 The current planetary aspects are heightening your natural compassion for other people. Your relationships will be at the front of your mind today, Aries. You feel good about yourself and other people can tell! People are attracted to you and wish to partake of your healing serenity. Listen without judgment as people pour out their hearts. That is a very precious skill.
 ----- 
 You were born with a certain grace and beauty, Taurus. Today you will be able to cultivate your love for beautiful things. You may feel like trying on designer clothes or expressing your innate aesthetic sense by painting. Today your five senses will guide you with the help of your imagination and your artist's temperament.
 ----- 
 You have some very urgent desires, but they remain a secret to everyone else. In solitude, you cultivate your interest in philosophy and mysticism. Today, it's as if you're absent from the world. Your body and actions are in the real world, but you have gone so far into yourself that it will be hard for people around you to get you out! What incredible concentration!
 ----- 
 You're usually the life of the party, but today you may want to pull into your cocoon, far away from the world and all its noise. You need to empty yourself of all negative ideas and thoughts. It's time to do some mental housecleaning and rid yourself of notions that were planted in you as a child. Now you can start all over again.
 ----- 
 Your judgment about people relies too much on general opinion, Leo. As soon as you meet someone, you accept what others think about him or her without trying to find out more. This lack of curiosity could lead you to make a hasty decision about someone today. If you take the time to listen with your heart, you could be impressed by what you hear.
 ----- 
 Do you have a tendency to give more weight to popular opinion than your own feelings, Virgo? Maybe you only want to see movies that everyone talks about, listen to the popular music, or read best sellers. In short, your tastes are exactly like most of America's. Is this what you want? Even when you don't like a movie, you may say you do if everyone else does. Listen to your ideas today.
 ----- 
 Your thoughts are leaning toward the past, Libra. You aren't moving backward, but you may want to get in touch with your roots in order to move into the future. You would also like to better understand of the mistakes of the past. You're going to be something of a psychoanalyst today.
 ----- 
 People can read you like a book today, Scorpio. Because of the current planetary positions, you're a bit touchier than usual. Your reactions to certain situations are written all over your face. You're blushing and your hands are sweating and trembling. Each of your gestures reveals emotion. This would be a great time to be in love. Watch out for love at first sight!
 ----- 
 Your excellent analytical skills may not be up to par over the next few days. You seem overwhelmed by your emotions. You have a hard time hiding your feelings and processing the information you receive. Instead of trying to understand people, you tend to interpret their actions and imagine things that aren't true. Be careful of your judgment at the moment. It's way off base!
 ----- 
 The planetary aspects invite you to explore strong expressions of feeling, Capricorn. A declaration of love, autobiography, spiritual confession, apology, or reconciliation. All these kinds of communication bring a kind of intimate revelation. This might be what you need in order to take advantage of the powerful inspiration of the moment.
 ----- 
 This is an excellent time to share your feelings with the person you love, Aquarius. It might seem a little scary to you. You're usually a reserved person, but you may surprise yourself with the passionate declarations that reflect your happiness now. Take advantage of this, because things could change over the next few days. You may go back into reclusive mode!
 ----- 
 You may feel like walking barefoot, comforting your friends, or playing with children. There's a tenderness and openness in the air that affects everyone. It will be like a wonderful day in the country, where everyone is happy to see each other, hug, and tell old family stories for the hundredth time. These days make young people laugh and old people smile.
 ----- 
 This isn't the time to make any more of a commitment to your relationship, Aries. You aren't satisfied with your attitude toward things lately. Don't forget that your partner's characteristics may have something to do with it! You have two months to take care of things. Take advantage of this reevaluation period. It doesn't happen that often.
 ----- 
 Today you might want to think about getting things straight with the people close to you. It's possible you haven't dealt with any problems you had in your relationships last month, Taurus. It's time to look at things again. You may have hidden certain things from yourself. You need to be much more honest about what you want in your personal life.
 ----- 
 You may be asking certain questions about your feelings, Gemini. Do you know about the trap that many people get caught up in 
 ----- 
 Nothing can hold back your flame for long, Cancer. You have a hard time resting your body and recharging your batteries. At the moment, you're probably still going through a deep transformation that won't allow you to slow down. Take the time to meditate and get in touch with your feelings. What is it you really want out of life?
 ----- 
 You can be known for needing a lot of love, but you will never admit that to yourself, much less anyone else. Sometimes it seems as if you like feeling emotionally frustrated. Today is the perfect day to meditate about whether or not this is true of you. Do you talk to other people about your emotional needs?
 ----- 
 You probably aren't worried about being conventional in your relationships, Virgo. In fact, conventionality is often what causes you problems. If you're wondering what morality is and what it's based on, this is a good day to think about these questions.
 ----- 
 You may not be very precise. Your motto seems to be "everything is relative." However, paying attention to details doesn't necessarily mean that you lose sight of the fundamentals. Your friends could tell you that. If you're an artist, you might make an effort today to be clearer in your expression and a little more down to Earth.
 ----- 
 This isn't a good time to make any big relationship decisions. If you're thinking about starting a relationship, moving in together, or getting married, you may feel a bit troubled by your decision, Scorpio. Take advantage of the day to reevaluate things objectively. There may be some issues to resolve before you go any further.
 ----- 
 Today you may feel like something is holding you back, Sagittarius. Everything was going just fine until now. If you believe the stream of chatter in your head today, you will be regressing in every area of your life! For example, you may be afraid to go any further in your relationship because of your past failures. Use this time to lay the past to rest.
 ----- 
 You may be looking for some new values in your personal life, Capricorn. You're no longer interested in superficial or frivolous relationships. You need to meet different kinds of people and select friends who are really worth keeping. Don't worry if you feel like taking a step back to get some perspective, because this is the time to do it. Relationships are too important to neglect.
 ----- 
 You may want to take a little trip into your past to visit some old friends, Aquarius. You could find yourself daydreaming through your good and bad memories. This is an excellent period to break with some of the more negative ties to your past. If your partner is a little worried about you going back in time at the moment, reassure him or her.
 ----- 
 If you're concerned about the love that certain close people have for you, you shouldn't try to compensate by being clingy or overly affectionate. This period is about keeping your distance and putting your relationships into perspective to see what they're really worth to you, Pisces. Someone may ask you for an even stronger commitment over the next few months.
 ----- 
 It's likely that you will succeed at whatever you set out to accomplish today, Aries. If you've been held back by worries over the integrity of a relationship or the long
 ----- 
 Your energy may flag a bit today, Taurus. There's nothing to worry about, though you could take better care of your health. What happened to that exercise regimen you vowed to start? It's never too late to improve your eating habits and begin working out. Even if you only walk three times a week, you will notice a dramatic difference in your appearance and outlook.
 ----- 
 Today is meant for socializing and connecting, Gemini. Your creativity is at an all
 ----- 
 You can't help but notice that your home looks a bit drab, Cancer. Today you could plan to do something about it. It won't take much money, just time and a little creativity. Paint some samples on the walls. Your spirits will improve. You can make big changes to the mood of the place simply by introducing more color.
 ----- 
 You have a to
 ----- 
 You're ready for a career change, Virgo, or at least a change of venue. Have you considered telecommuting one day per week? That might give you the variety you seek without needing to find a new job. You may meet someone today or in the near future who will have a dramatic influence on your career decisions. Listen carefully.
 ----- 
 What is your dream, Libra? Answer that question as specifically as possible today, then set about attaining that goal. All signs indicate that whatever you begin today will pay off big time. Even though you may feel that your dreams are too ambitious, there's no need to feel overwhelmed. Vow to take things one step at a time. Keep in mind the old adage, "Once begun is half done."
 ----- 
 This may seem odd, Scorpio, but you may not be the person you think you are. There are indications that you have hidden talents. If they come out today, no one will be more shocked than you! This could take your career in an entirely new direction. Strategize ways to incorporate this talent into your career. Your work will take on a new dynamic, and you will take a major leap forward.
 ----- 
 You're about to experience a major change in your life's direction, Sagittarius, and it may occur today. Keep your mind open to all sorts of possibilities. You're likely to receive some important information. Of course, you may not realize its importance right away. It's only with the passage of time that you will look back on this event as pivotal. Make sure you don't miss it.
 ----- 
 You're unstoppable today, Capricorn. It seems you can do anything. Your confidence and energy are high. There's no question that you're ready to take the world by storm. Is the world ready for you? Think carefully as you formulate plans for your new project. Whatever you do will succeed, but be sure you're doing what you really want to do rather than what others expect of you.
 ----- 
 It's likely that you're being held back by certain traumatic past events. Before you can make further progress in your life, Aquarius, you must address these painful memories for the last time. If it feels too frightening to do alone, seek professional help. You will find that mustering the courage to do this difficult, emotional housecleaning is more than half the battle.
 ----- 
 You could receive some sort of windfall today, Pisces. Use it wisely. Consider buying some time to figure out what you want to do with your life. It's likely that your career isn't exactly ringing your bells these days. You're ready for new challenges and opportunities. Meditate on what would make you happy and then take a systematic approach to achieving it.
 ----- 
 You're looking good and feeling great, Aries. Now if only your home environment reflected who you are. As you look around, you may realize that it isn't as elegant as it could be. Today you can begin to change it. Begin with the basics 
 ----- 
 Sign up for a class or workshop today. Your career could greatly benefit from more training. A short computer course might be all you need to move your career a giant leap forward. Don't neglect your artistic abilities, Taurus. Ideally, you will find a way to integrate your creative talents into your daily business life. There's always room for creativity.
 ----- 
 You've been working especially hard lately, Gemini, and today you may begin to reap the benefits of all your hard work. Some project that's dear to your heart may be nearing completion, and even you are impressed by the results! All those naysayers who said it would never work are now looking at you with admiration and respect. Give yourself a pat on the back for your accomplishment.
 ----- 
 There's no other way to say this, Cancer 
 ----- 
 You have a generous spirit, Leo, which could get you into trouble if you aren't careful. When you get a gift of money or even a hint of one, your tendency is to buy presents for all your friends. It's hard to fault you for this, but there are other ways to show your affection. You could bake cookies to distribute, for example. This will keep your money safe and earning interest.
 ----- 
 You hardly even believe in love, much less love at first sight, Virgo, but something that occurs today may turn you into a believer. You never know when it will happen. You could be in line at the grocery store when someone catches your eye (and heart). Perhaps someone with whom you've only had a phone relationship suddenly shows up at your office. Adventure lies ahead.
 ----- 
 It's likely a hidden talent of yours is revealed today, Libra. All those scraps of writing could turn into something more concrete, such as a novel. Maybe you begin to dabble with your children's paint set and realize how much you enjoy the creative process. Be open to all possibilities. You may find your life takes a different, more authentic direction.
 ----- 
 You will feel especially close to family and friends today, Scorpio. There's a lot of positive energy in the air, and people feel optimistic and congenial. It's a pleasure to be with your loved ones, and interactions with strangers have a lovely flavor as well. Take advantage of the warm astral energy and plan a get
 ----- 
 You're likely feeling confident, optimistic, and enthusiastic today, Sagittarius. You feel as though anything is possible, and indeed it is. If you feel a bit of wanderlust and are anxious to explore new places and meet new people, you may soon receive the chance. Life is one great big adventure. You're fortunate to have the sort of spirit that embraces it fully.
 ----- 
 You have a wonderful combination of optimism and spirituality, Capricorn. You believe in miracles as well as angels, Santa Claus, and the Tooth Fairy. We support your attitude wholeheartedly! Today something may happen that only further solidifies your beliefs. Perhaps your guardian angel saves you from stepping in front of a bus, or you receive a telepathic message that stops you from making a bad career mistake.
 ----- 
 Don't be afraid to ask for help today, Aquarius. It may be that your friends and family help you with a task or you discover a mechanized solution that does the job for you. Technology can be a wonderful thing. Don't let any aversion to it stop you from incorporating it into your daily life. You will find that once you embrace innovation, it improves your quality of life dramatically.
 ----- 
 You can expect your love life to take a dramatic turn for the better, Pisces. This may be because you feel more self
 ----- 
 Too many invitations to social events may come today, Aries. This might be one evening when you want to relax at home, but you won't want to say no to anyone. Analyze each invitation. Consider the location, host, other guests 
 ----- 
 Today you might work on your spiritual practice or studies, Taurus. You could read a book on the subject, attend a lecture, or practice some kind of discipline such as yoga or meditation. The only caveat is don't try to do too much at once. You could tire yourself out. Concentrate on one thing at a time. The information will still be there tomorrow!
 ----- 
 Physical pleasure may be at the top of your priority list today, Gemini. You might want to go to your favorite restaurant and have a great meal, including wine, appetizers, and dessert. Or you might feel especially energetic and want to take your partner for a complete spa treatment. Whatever your desires, exercise some restraint You can get too much of a good thing!
 ----- 
 Love matters may prove too intense today, Cancer. You may be having a rough week. Your partner may be especially demanding of your time and energy. This might be a good day to schedule some time alone. Go for a massage, sauna, or hot tub 
 ----- 
 You've been hoping for a quiet day on the job, Leo, but too many calls could come your way. You might have to juggle several at once. Don't try to deal with every problem. Exercise your triage abilities and take care of the most pressing first. Let the others go, if necessary. You aren't doing anyone any favors by getting too distracted. Even you can be less than thorough when overwhelmed.
 ----- 
 Were you planning to go shopping today, Virgo? If you can, put it off until tomorrow. You could be tempted by too many items that seem wonderful in the store but are nothing but a bother once you get them home. If you must go, make the effort to bypass shops where you might fall into this trap. You don't want to have to make a second trip to bring back returns.
 ----- 
 You look especially attractive today, Libra, and it's doing wonders for your self
 ----- 
 Today, Scorpio, you might want to make an unqualified declaration of love. That's fine if you've been involved for a while, although you could overwhelm your partner. If the relationship is new, beware! This could feel like too much too soon. Your friend could respond by backing away or even disappearing. Use restraint or you might have the opposite effect to the one you want.
 ----- 
 A friend may offer you a gift today, Sagittarius. It could involve money, favors, time, items you need, or something else. Be discriminating about what you accept, and make sure you offer to reciprocate. Insist, if you must. As generous as your friend may be now, later he or she could feel used or else call in some favors that you aren't willing to perform. Accept graciously, within limitations.
 ----- 
 The temptation to take center stage might be too strong to resist, Capricorn. Someone may ask you to tell a story. Your gift with words and vivid imagination should serve you well. Keep it brief. If you go on too long, your friends could fidget. Time your performance by watching their expressions. Do it right and you will be asked to do it again.
 ----- 
 A gathering could bring you lots of good news and useful information, Aquarius. The problem is that there might be too much. You will want to remember it all, but your memory may not be as sharp as usual. Before you attend a gathering, grab a notebook and pen. That way you can write down whatever you want to look into later.
 ----- 
 You generally enjoy your dreams, Pisces, both the dreaming process and analyzing them later. But tonight you might have too many to keep track of. While you will probably recall the most significant ones, it may be frustrating if you forget any of them. This might be the day to start a dream diary, if you don't have one. Have fun!
 ----- 
 Something you read today could have a dramatic effect on your life, Aries. Pay particular attention to dream psychology. You may find an explanation for a recurring dream. The accuracy of the description could stop you in your tracks and make you anxious to read more. You're right to be intrigued, Aries. You're bound to learn more about yourself as you study this particular area.
 ----- 
 Today you will likely be in the mood to nest with loved ones, Taurus. Encourage children and partner to stay home with you. Make some popcorn and pull out the board games. You will be surprised at how much fun a quiet day at home can be. Tonight, order pizza and watch a movie. Get out the blanket and cuddle.
 ----- 
 Today an article or TV show may set your mind spinning in the strangest directions. You could finally acknowledge your fascination with the occult, or perhaps discover an interest in dream interpretation. Let yourself indulge in your interests. Sometimes you don't take the time to pursue subjects that you don't deem "serious." Go ahead and explore your dark side!
 ----- 
 If you've been thinking about writing a novel or taking up oil painting, today is the day to begin. No excuses. You have just as much talent as anyone else, so why not use it? You might find it helpful to join a writing group or sign up for a painting workshop, if only to help you get started and stay motivated. Join a support group for artists. They will understand.
 ----- 
 You clean house like someone with an attention problem, Leo. You never stick with one task. Your bathroom mirrors and counters will get cleaned, but not the floor. Make an effort to clean thoroughly, one room at a time. Even if you don't get through the whole house, you will receive some satisfaction from knowing that parts of it are spotless.
 ----- 
 Today you may need to be more selfless, Virgo. You may moan about the obligations and expectations placed on you, but you do what's expected. Much to your surprise, you actually find that you get more out of the experience than you put into it. You may visit a nursing home and be charmed by stories of the war years. Keep your mind and heart open. You will be richly rewarded.
 ----- 
 You may receive a letter or phone call that spurs you into action, Libra. You might realize how close you are to reaching a long
 ----- 
 This may not be your preferred way to spend the day, but it would be an ideal time to finish up tasks that have been piling up at home, Scorpio. It would do you good to catch up on cleaning or get more organized around the house. Yes, Scorpio, that means throwing away last year's newspapers and magazines. If you haven't read them by now, you're not likely to!
 ----- 
 You're a dedicated soul to spend precious personal time doing household chores, but certain things need to get done. If you still haven't done all the laundry or read all the magazines, then tackle these first. Completing them will motivate you to move on to the next task. Before you know it, you will be sitting pretty in a neat, organized home. Sagittarius.
 ----- 
 You're an avid reader, Capricorn. Today you may come across some ideas that inspire ideas of your own. Perhaps you read something gives you an idea for a short story. Maybe an interview with a famous musician reignites your desire to play the piano. Pay attention to these yearnings. Write them down. When you review them in a few days, you will see which ones still have a strong pull on you.
 ----- 
 You can expect to have a confusing encounter with a friend or colleague today, Aquarius. He or she may come to you for advice but hesitate to reveal the specifics of the problem. You will feel as though you've been asked to mediate an argument, yet you only know one side of the story. Be patient. Gently probe for more details. If they aren't forthcoming, change the subject!
 ----- 
 You're feeling strong, energetic, and likely to be inspired to get some real work done around the house, Pisces. Focus on the most mundane chores, such as reorganizing bookshelves or going through the clothes you no longer wear. This day won't be the epitome of intellectual activity, but you will be rewarded with a tidy living space.
 ----- 
 You may be asked to slow down today, Aries. Whether this comes in the form of a speeding ticket or a scrape on the knee when you trip, you must listen to this message. The key for you now isn't to get too emotional as a result of this slowdown. Know that it's for your own good. Don't complain about it 
 ----- 
 Share your skills today, Taurus. You will find that as you engage in the role of teacher, you learn more than if you just hold onto your knowledge without sharing it. You will be challenged in ways you didn't even think possible. Perhaps you will be forced to do a little research when questions arise that you don't know how to answer.
 ----- 
 Don't underestimate the power of other people today, Gemini. They may seem flighty and scatterbrained on the outside, but underneath you will find that they have a great deal of wisdom to share. It might take some probing on your part to draw this wisdom out, but once you do, the outpouring of information will richly reward you.
 ----- 
 Remember that there's a benevolent force out there that loves you, Cancer. No matter what, there's always a shoulder to cry on, even if it isn't a tangible one. Even in your darkest moments, you're never alone. Let this knowledge carry you through the day. Feel free to share it with others who seem like they could use a lift.
 ----- 
 Don't hesitate to say the obvious today, Leo, even if it sounds corny. Many times people hesitate to say what they really feel because they think it's obvious to everyone. The truth of the matter is that most people aren't mind readers and probably aren't picking up on the subtle signals that you send out. Help them by speaking frankly.
 ----- 
 Look to older figures for advice today, Virgo. Seek counsel with a parent or grandparent on issues you feel strongly about. Relationships with older people are likely to go especially well, and you will find you can break through barriers that may have existed between you and a certain member of your family. Make a conscious effort to patch any rifts among your closest kin.
 ----- 
 Consider composing a bit of poetry today, Libra. Use this as an exercise to condense your ocean of emotions into a very few words. You might find that a great deal of your inner turmoil really boils down to just one or two central things. Let your written words express this as succinctly as possible.
 ----- 
 Just because your emotions are reserved or somber today doesn't mean you shouldn't share them with others, Scorpio. Work through difficulties by processing your feelings and running them by someone close. Keep your interaction limited to just one person at a time so you don't get overshadowed by a third party who wants to get their opinion in at the same time.
 ----- 
 You may need to jump to many different people and situations today, Sagittarius, yet something is holding you back. Listen to this inner voice that's asking you to be conservative at this time. You have many more profound things to say when you filter your thoughts through a large funnel. Be open and accepting of many things, but only allow a limited outflow.
 ----- 
 You feel like you have a stone strapped to your back, Capricorn. The farther you walk with this load, the slower you go, and the more hunched over you will be by the time you reach your destination. Unloaded the stone from your pack. Realize that this break in your journey will help you make much better time in the long run and save you from a great deal of physical strain.
 ----- 
 Feel free to break ties with certain people now, Aquarius. You may be overextending your emotional bank account by investing too much of yourself in others' lives. You may not even realize how much this sort of action taxes you until you rid yourself of unnecessary baggage. Make phone calls shorter and time in the bathtub longer.
 ----- 
 Less is more should be your motto for today, Pisces. The more you cut back in certain areas of your life, the more room you open up to bring in new and exciting things. Go ahead and say no to people, and don't feel badly about it. Take care of yourself and your needs as much as you take care of the needs of the people around you.
 ----- 
 Today is your lucky day, Aries. You may get a windfall of some sort, maybe a check in the mail or a raise or promotion at work. This is just what you've been hoping for to elevate your lifestyle. Don't go nuts. Invest the money wisely and it will keep you rolling in dough. Spend it all at once and you won't have much to show for it in a few years.
 ----- 
 Airline travel is indicated in your immediate future, Taurus. It's likely you've been feeling serious wanderlust lately, as well as frustration with the same old routine. Be open to any interesting invitations that come your way today. If a friend invites you for a night out on the town, go despite any hesitation. You're bound to have a wonderful time, and you need the diversion.
 ----- 
 Your ship comes in, Gemini. Don't be surprised if you find a big, fat check waiting for you. Who knows what you've done to deserve such kindness? Don't question your good fortune 
 ----- 
 You can expect to reap the benefits from recent training or studies, Cancer. You've made a huge leap in ability, especially where technological skills are concerned. As a result, you can expect to receive either a promotion or raise. It's the least your boss can do to reward you for all your hard work of late. If you continue at this pace, you will soon be running the company!
 ----- 
 You may receive some important information today. This message could have a dramatic ripple effect on your life. You may change jobs or even move to a different part of the country, all as a result of the information you receive. You may be nervous about making such dramatic changes to your life, but trust that they're for the better. Dare to take the risk, Leo.
 ----- 
 If you have no significant other, Virgo, all indications are that this will soon change. A friend may set you up on a blind date that turns out to be a real winner. Perhaps you suddenly look at a long
 ----- 
 You have a persuasive nature, Libra. Take care that you don't come on too strong today. You may try to rally support for a favored cause of yours. By all means, spread the word, but let others come to you if they're interested. You tend to beat people over the head about doing the "right" thing. Don't pressure anyone. If just a few people help, at least they will be truly committed.
 ----- 
 What a day this could be, Scorpio. You may get an unexpected raise that seems to manifest out of the blue. Who knew it was possible? You may have a close friend to thank. He or she may have been responsible for making sure you were in the right place at the right time. Your life could change dramatically as a result. Hold on for what is bound to be a wild ride!
 ----- 
 In spite of any feelings to the contrary, Sagittarius, you're bound to be successful. You may be involved in a group project that requires a lot of time and effort. All indications are that it will pay off shortly. Continue to work those long hours, even if it means staying up all night. In just a few months, you will catch up on sleep and be rolling in money.
 ----- 
 You feel energetic and optimistic, Capricorn. You can do anything you set your mind to! This positive outlook is a refreshing change from the usual pessimism. It's certainly easier to go through life happy. As someone once said, people pretty much choose whether or not they're going to be happy. Kudos to you for making the right choice. You're bound to be successful once you believe you can be.
 ----- 
 You may not want to leave the house today! You may not feel very social and prefer to spend time alone. You could go through old photographs, read old letters, and look through the attic. Pondering memories with a new perspective may clear up some things. With the wisdom and experience you've gained over the years, certain past issues may now finally make sense.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if you bump into an old friend or colleague today, Pisces. This chance encounter could have a dramatic ripple effect on you as you reflect on your life and analyze how far you've come. You may realize you aren't entirely pleased with your direction. Your friend may point out that there are many paths to happiness. Perhaps it's time to choose another one.
 ----- 
 You may feel wanderlust and crave something new and different in your life. You just can't help but be a bit bored by the dullness of the routine. If adventure is what you want, why not plan an exotic trip? Even if you don't have the money now, you can still start doing some research. Just knowing that you're going to go someday will help raise your spirits, Aries.
 ----- 
 Keep your eyes and ears open today, Taurus. You may receive some important information on specific ways to increase your income. This is just one of the many wonderful things bound to happen to you. You're looking great and people are responding to your warm, pleasant manner. Bask in the glow of all the goodwill surrounding you. It won't last forever!
 ----- 
 You may be privy to some important knowledge, Gemini. Perhaps an article gives you the impetus you need to invest in a promising stock. Perhaps you learn a famous person is coming to town to give a lecture. If your heart starts to race the minute you hear the news, this should be all the motivation you need to take the next steps. Good things are bound to come your way if you do.
 ----- 
 A visit to a local museum or art gallery may move you to tears, Cancer. Suddenly, you're aware of all the beauty around you and inspired to create some original works of your own. You do have a strong creative bent, so why not see how far your talent will take you? If possible, spend the evening surrounded by loved ones.
 ----- 
 There are no half measures today, Leo. You feel every emotion to the nth degree. This could make for an intense day. Make an effort to calm down. Rather than inject your opinion into every conversation, make it a point to step away from the group. The talk is animated enough without you stirring things up further. Spend the evening with loved ones. They will be more tolerant of your mood.
 ----- 
 You're likely feeling a desire to do something different and a little crazy. Today you may fulfill that desire by attending a group event, perhaps a concert. Or you could indulge a childhood fantasy and go to the circus. Whatever you do, take along the special someone in your life. The fun you're bound to have will be so much sweeter when shared with a loved one.
 ----- 
 You have many talents, Libra. Today's astral energy indicates that your abilities will be rewarded. Congratulations! You've certainly worked long and hard to achieve your goals. Why not make plans to celebrate? Call some friends or your partner for an impromptu get
 ----- 
 You're looking gorgeous today, Scorpio, and have likely noticed the admiring glances you've received. Your passion is running high, and you may be able to spend this evening with a special someone. Fulfill your romantic fantasies. Light candles, use your best china, and dress with sensuality in mind. Your partner will appreciate the effort. You're bound to have a wonderful evening.
 ----- 
 This could be your lucky day, Sagittarius, especially in matters of the heart. You may feel particularly close to your special someone, as well as others in your immediate circle of friends. This is due in part to the planetary configuration. It shows your intuition and optimism running high. Use this to your advantage, especially if you have to sell something. Keep your expectations realistic.
 ----- 
 Try not to do everything all at once today, Capricorn. Your social life is heating up and you may be in a frenzy preparing for all the gatherings you've been invited to. All this on top of your regular workload could send you into a tailspin. Pace yourself. Get your work done first before thinking about your social life. Remember, if you were unemployed, you wouldn't be able to go out at all!
 ----- 
 It looks like your ship is about to come in, Aquarius. The planetary configuration indicates that you can expect additional financial resources, perhaps a raise. You deserve it! You've been working long and hard these past several months. You've earned the respect of authority figures and the admiration of peers. Be careful not to fritter away the extra money. Put some aside for a rainy day.
 ----- 
 Take extra care with your appearance today, and clean the house a bit this morning. You may have some visitors, Pisces. Invite them in and make them comfortable. It's likely that they can be of great benefit in furthering your career. Perhaps one of them is well connected in a company you've long wanted to work for. Or maybe you will get an interesting stock tip. Stay alert!
 ----- 
 You might have trouble with your plumbing today, Aries, particularly if you have a big kitchen. This is too complex a problem to handle yourself. Pay the money to have a professional take care of the problem. It will save you work and frustration. In the meantime, have a pizza delivered while you're waiting to get your kitchen back!
 ----- 
 Are you having problems with your phone, Taurus? Is traffic out of control? Perhaps it might be best to stay home today and put conversations with your friends on hold for a while. You might miss a call from someone far away, but the person will try to reach you later. Relax, make yourself some tea, and enjoy the silence. A little quiet time now and then is good for you.
 ----- 
 A treasured possession might be missing somewhere in the house today, Gemini. No matter where you look, you won't be able to find it. This could stimulate your determination, and you might end up searching for hours. The object is in the house, but it's probably under something, perhaps in a place you would never dream of looking. Check the biggest rooms in the house.
 ----- 
 A romantic partner might suggest a trip together, Cancer, perhaps to a place you've been anxious to see. This is a possibility, but now your friend is merely kicking the idea around. If you like the idea, don't respond too enthusiastically right now or your friend might feel threatened and back off. In fact, don't talk much at all. Listen and nod agreeably!
 ----- 
 Uncomfortable intuitive impressions from someone close might be troubling, Leo. Is your friend ill or bothered by events out of his or her control? Your friend probably won't want to talk much about it, so you will just have to let them tell you what's going on when the time is right. This could be frustrating for you, but be patient. That's all you can do now.
 ----- 
 A goal you've been pursuing may be unworkable now, Virgo. You may have to put it on hold for a while. This could be disappointing, but think about it carefully. What other dreams do you have? Figure out which ones are most important to you and then decide which are most promising right now. Sometimes little setbacks like this prove to be blessings in disguise.
 ----- 
 Confusion may reign today as you try to glean some information that seems to be totally elusive, Libra. Are you researching a project? Are some of the facts obscure? For now, it might be better to work on something else and go back to your research in a few days. To keep at it now might involve you in a lot of work for negligible results.
 ----- 
 A sibling or neighbor might be compelled to move away, Scorpio. This might be emotionally wrenching, and you could have a difficult conversation with this person. It isn't always easy to let go of someone you care about, but this could be a valuable lesson in detachment. It will probably take you a while get used to the idea, though you still won't like it. Hang in there!
 ----- 
 Money matters might seem disastrous today, Sagittarius. You may have had a temporary setback, but you're probably being especially pessimistic and not seeing the whole picture. Sit down and try to juggle a few figures. You will probably find that you're better off than it seemed at first. Whatever expenses come up, you will be able to handle them. Focus on what needs to be done and do it!
 ----- 
 A temporary separation from a romantic partner might have you despairing today, Capricorn. Your imagination may conjure up all sorts of dreadful scenarios, like your beloved finding someone else. Don't do this to yourself. Your friend probably misses you, too. Keep busy so the days pass quickly until your friend comes back and you're together again. Be patient!
 ----- 
 Have you been walking or exercising too much lately, Aquarius? If so, you might experience aching feet and legs today. Wear comfortable shoes and stay off your feet as much as you can in order to allow the pains to heal. You might want to relax in a hot tub at some point, preferably with a romantic partner! This is one way to turn a misfortune into a great time.
 ----- 
 A close friend or romantic partner might be in a negative mood today, Pisces. You may want to try to lift this person out of that mood. Take your friend to a sporting event, party, or funny movie. If you're refused at first, don't take no for an answer! It will do your friend good to get out of that funk, and it will do you good as well!
 ----- 
 Your intuition is operating at a high level, Aries, but you may not be able to make sense of the psychic impressions you're receiving. The emotions, images, and symbols you pick up from others and the astral plane could be vague and easily misinterpreted. They could be important, though. Write them down and look at them in a day or so. You should be able to make sense of them then.
 ----- 
 Creative energy may be high today, Taurus, but you may be unable to use it the way you'd like. Perhaps you don't have a project to work on or you have writer's block. Ideas may come, but you don't know what to do with them. The best course may be to write them down. The very process of writing could open doors for you. At least you will have your thoughts for another day.
 ----- 
 A family member may withdraw from you, Gemini. This person appears to be going through a private emotional crisis and isn't apt to confide in you now. Your inclination could be to push it, but this could be a mistake. Give him or her the chance to share with you when the time is right. Sometimes we need to work things out for ourselves. Be patient.
 ----- 
 You could get some strange phone calls today, Cancer. There could be a few hang
 ----- 
 Money matters may seem up in the air today, Leo. Your usual practicality may desert you. This could make you stressed and angry because you're perfectly capable of dealing with your finances. Don't worry. The vagueness should pass by tomorrow. In the meantime, get some help, or if your concerns aren't too urgent, wait a day or two. Give yourself a break.
 ----- 
 You might be in the midst of an exciting creative project with a partner, Virgo, and anxious to move forward so that you can present it to the public. But you might feel distracted and unable to focus on your work. Don't get too upset. These things happen. Be patient and wait until tomorrow if you have to. You will be back in the groove by then.
 ----- 
 If you've been planning to spend a day meditating, Libra, this is the day to do it. You're in an elevated frame of mind, not in a space to focus on mundane matters. Artistic inspiration could come to you now. Any kind of exercise should get the endorphins flowing. But don't expect to get any practical work done. You're definitely out of this world.
 ----- 
 Communication with friends and lovers may be limited by emotional factors today, Scorpio. You may have a tendency to overreact to casual comments that are probably innocent but that you misinterpret as offensive. Quarrels over nothing could result, which could raise your blood pressure and stress level for no good reason. If ever there was a day to think before speaking, this is it.
 ----- 
 A phone call could inform you of difficulties at home that require that you deal with them right away, Sagittarius. This is nothing to be alarmed about, just one of those irritating little hassles that requires attention when you'd rather turn in another direction. It could be as innocuous as a broken appliance. Take care of it efficiently so you can get back to your activities. Stay calm!
 ----- 
 A rather spacey friend or acquaintance from far away could call today, Capricorn, perhaps to propose a visit. This might not be convenient now, and could put you in a quandary as to whether or not to agree to it. Your decision eventually comes down to how much you care for this person and how badly you want to see him or her. Think carefully before saying yes or no.
 ----- 
 Financial paperwork might have you baffled today, Aquarius. You might not be in the right frame of mind to do it now, so if it isn't urgent, wait a day or two. If you need to take care of it immediately, don't be too shy about consulting someone else. You will be glad you did, and you won't have to wonder whether or not you did it right.
 ----- 
 You and a current or potential romantic partner may be in a strange space today, Pisces. Intellectual awareness battles emotional doubts. Communication could be vague and easily misinterpreted, so choose your words carefully, even though it may be difficult to find the right ones. Your relationship should survive the day, but your understanding of each other could suffer if you aren't careful.
 ----- 
 You might not be able to concentrate on your work today, Aries. Your head may be in the clouds and your eye for detail could fail you somewhat. Needless to say, this isn't a good day to tackle new, difficult, or complicated tasks. Concentrate on routines that you can do without thinking. That way you will get through the day without making yourself crazy.
 ----- 
 Are you an artist, writer, or musician, Taurus? If so, your work may take on a more symbolic or impressionistic tone. Today you're probably more interested in conveying feelings and impressions than details. It might surprise you that you're thinking along those lines. This urge may vanish tomorrow, so if you like today's work, make the most of it. Try to remember how and why you're doing it!
 ----- 
 Innovative art forms might seem especially appealing today, Gemini. Stay out of gallery shops unless you're prepared to take home a carload of merchandise. If you're more into music, you might break the bank downloading tunes to your MP3 player. This could be a new phase in your artistic tastes or it could be a longstanding trend. Whichever it is, have fun!
 ----- 
 Do you believe in ghosts? Some strange phone calls, emails, or other communications may come your way today, Cancer. One may come from someone who thinks you're someone else. Phone calls may be hang
 ----- 
 An unexpected sum of money could come your way today, Leo. It probably won't be large, but it will be welcome nonetheless. Perhaps someone has owed you money for a long time and finally repays it. Or you might sell an item you've wanted to unload for a long time. Whatever it is, you might want to take a friend to dinner. Go for it and have fun!
 ----- 
 Have you been exercising too rigorously lately, Virgo? If so, you might feel some little aches and pains. Stay off your feet for most of the day. When you exercise, concentrate on stretching. Spend some time soaking in a hot tub if you can. The old saying, "No pain, no gain" has pretty much been discredited! Yoga or tai chi could serve you as well as aerobics today. Stick with those!
 ----- 
 The feeling that someone is coming to visit you might be with you throughout the day, Libra. Your intuition is probably right, except for one thing 
 ----- 
 Are all of your friends into astrology, divine science, or spiritual matters, Scorpio? It might seem like most of them are today, anyway. You may have many new friends in those fields. You have a lot to learn from all of them, and even more that you can learn together. A giant spurt of personal growth is right around the corner.
 ----- 
 A love partner may host a social event or meeting of some kind, Sagittarius. It might be interesting to get acquainted with friends of your mate you haven't yet met. Some of them are probably intelligent, interesting people in fascinating professions. One of them could recommend a few books that you will definitely want to read. Have fun. Don't forget to thank your sweetheart!
 ----- 
 Are you contemplating a trip, Capricorn, perhaps to a place you've always dreamed of visiting? If you're in doubt as to whether or not you can do it, work out your budget and you might be surprised. Invite a friend or romantic partner to accompany you. Such a trip could boost your personal growth like nothing you've ever tried before. Think about it!
 ----- 
 Material values may pale beside spiritual ones today, Aquarius. You might consider giving up the rat race and retreating to the wilderness. This would perhaps make a good vacation, but you probably aren't ready to chuck it all just yet. Don't be too hard on yourself if your enjoyment of worldly pleasures returns tomorrow. Changes like this come gradually, not overnight. Take it at your own pace.
 ----- 
 A current or potential romantic partner might seem like the most perfect, wonderful person in the world to you, Pisces. Your romantic nature could get the better of you today. Don't gaze at your partner all dewy eyed! Instead, try to maintain a certain distance to avoid appearing too needy. It was probably your self
 ----- 
 Your strength lies in your inner resources, Aries. Today you will find that these resources have opened up within you. You will find that your emotions are calm and under control in the face of chaos. This time of new beginnings is extremely important. It would behoove you to probe your depths and fix any internal quirks that might give you trouble in the future.
 ----- 
 Offer your services to others, Taurus. Your generosity in spreading your knowledge will be rewarded. Things might be rather confusing at first, but once you start talking, you will be surprised by how much you really know and how far your incredible wit, manners, and sociable attitude can take you. Try your best to reach out to others without seeming needy or demanding.
 ----- 
 If you feel slighted today, Gemini, don't shut yourself off from the situation. It may seem like everyone has ganged up and turned against you. Either that, or they all want to be your best friend. Things are always extreme for you, with no in
 ----- 
 You may wake up in a fog of confusion this morning for some reason, Cancer. The good news is that the air is likely to clear as the day continues. By late afternoon and early evening, you should be revved up and ready to go once again. Your normal self has returned and you're ready to face the world with a dramatic show of courageous action and adventure.
 ----- 
 Here's a suggestion. If you get a strange vibe about a situation today, walk away, Leo. Your instincts will tell you if something is dangerous or not. If you don't feel safe, find another place to be. You won't be productive in an environment where you don't feel comfortable. You will also enjoy yourself much more if you can relax in the situation instead of being uptight about it.
 ----- 
 It's time to take charge of your life, Virgo. Don't rely on other people to sort out your problems. There may some anxiety in the air today that causes you to overreact to a situation that normally wouldn't faze you. You need to dig down and take responsibility for getting out of this mental or emotional jam. Don't rely on other people to do it for you.
 ----- 
 It's time to show other people that you have backbone, Libra. It could be that up until now very few people have noticed, since you're so flexible and adaptable to change. You easily wriggle your way downstream, and as a result, people may think they can control you. Prove to them that this isn't the case by setting your own agenda and sticking to it.
 ----- 
 You may be anxious to get some new projects underway today, Scorpio, even though they aren't necessarily ready or well thought out. You must first learn that patience is key. Jumping the gun could cause a false start that disqualifies you from the race. Avoid this fate by playing it cool and laying low. Keep your big guns under wraps for now. You don't need to bring out all the heavy artillery yet.
 ----- 
 There's a romantic, dreamy feeling to today that you should indulge in, Sagittarius. If you have a special someone in your life, this is the perfect day to share these feelings! Try to plan a candlelit dinner at home for just the two of you. But don't feel pressured to cook an elaborate meal. Pick up some Chinese and serve it on the good china. Keep the focus on the two of you.
 ----- 
 You might not be in the mood to cooperate today, Capricorn. You will most likely want to work on projects alone at your own pace. You will probably have to come out of your shell and interact with others. You may need advice or input. Try not to be too pouty with your partner or kids. They might not understand the real reason why you're distracted.
 ----- 
 Start today on the right foot by projecting a positive mood and healthy mindset, Aquarius. If you're dragging your heels and already dreading the forthcoming events, you will only succeed in making it harder to move ahead, regardless of what you end up doing. Attitude is everything. This is one of those days in which it matters the most.
 ----- 
 You may discover your emotions are tempered today, as you want to turn inward, Pisces. You're apt to surprise yourself and the people around you when you decide that all you want to do is go into your room and sit by yourself instead of join the crowd outside. Don't feel bad about doing this even if you're expected at the party in full regalia. Do what feels most natural for you.
 ----- 
 Listen carefully when you receive instructions today, Aries. Your mind may not be as sharp as usual. If you aren't careful, you could get on the wrong track and end up having to start all over again. Don't be too shy or ashamed to ask questions. It's always better to ask a question than make an unnecessary error. Proceed slowly and methodically and you will get through the day!
 ----- 
 A heightened sense of idealized romance could hit you today, Taurus. If you aren't currently involved, beware! That wonderful new person you've just met may have a well
 ----- 
 Something you feel you desperately need right now is missing, Gemini, and it's very well hidden. You may search the house for it and drive yourself crazy in the process. Do you really need it that badly? If so, sit for a moment and try to collect your thoughts. If you can't, leave it for now. You may find it by chance or through a sudden insight. Relax and hang in there!
 ----- 
 Don't listen to gossip today, Cancer. Any rumors that are spreading are likely to be based on false assumptions and totally outside the realm of reality. Yet someone who loves to talk is very convincing! Take anything you hear that you can't immediately verify with a grain of salt, if not the whole shaker. There's definitely something weird going on. Avoid it!
 ----- 
 A luxury you've been craving could seem very tempting today, Leo. Make sure you're really ready, willing, and able to spend the money to get it. Think about it carefully before whipping out your credit card. Do you really want it that much? Is the expense feasible right now? If so, go for it. Luxuries aren't always a waste of money. They can do wonders for your self
 ----- 
 Emotional turmoil may overwhelm your usual objectivity and good sense today, Virgo. Family problems could weigh on your mind, as communication between you and family members may be lacking. You might not feel in touch with what's going on. Try to encourage them to talk to you. If they won't, move on. Sometimes people want to deal with their troubles on their own. It's their choice.
 ----- 
 Your imagination should fly high today, Libra. Whether you're into writing, music, or dance, make the most of your creative inspiration. If you don't, your ideas may vanish as soon as they appear. If you're too busy, at least make time to jot down your insights and any possibilities for developing them. Then you will have a record you can return to at a future date.
 ----- 
 Doubts about a friend may plague you today, Scorpio. Did this person borrow money? Promise to do you a favor? Can you depend on this person? The best way to judge is by their track record. If they've been undependable in the past, chances are they might be again. It might be best for you to turn to someone else. Today, at least, your friend is best left in the clouds.
 ----- 
 Confusion might get in the way of anything you hope to accomplish today, Sagittarius. You may feel like you're walking around in a daze, uncertain of your actions. Try to stay focused and be your usual practical, objective self. It might not come as easily for you as it usually does, but you can do it. Have some coffee and make a list of what needs to be done. Sometimes that's all it takes.
 ----- 
 Spiritual and metaphysical concepts may seem murky to you today, Capricorn. Ideas that friends accept as matters of course might feel strange. Don't get into an argument. Ask about books, websites, or magazines that you can consult for more input and, hopefully, clarity. Find out about future lectures on the subject. It should all come together eventually. You just need to be patient!
 ----- 
 A strange, bothersome feeling could plague you today, Aquarius, as if you can't remember something you need to do. Don't drive yourself crazy over this. Chances are you haven't forgotten anything but had a rather irritating dream. If you can't seem to shake the idea, try asking your subconscious to pull up the dream. Write it down. Once you know what it's all about, you will probably feel free again.
 ----- 
 Is a romantic partner having trouble communicating with family, Pisces? If so, be prepared to hear about it today. Be a good listener. Your understanding and objectivity will be greatly appreciated. Your beloved probably isn't seeing the real facts and needs an outside party to point this out. However, avoid the temptation to patronize. You could end up in the same doghouse!
 ----- 
 It's frustrating when work gets in the way of romance and social activities. This is what you feel today, Aries. Your thoughts are on your evening and weekend activities, but your obligations are on your desk. Don't despair. Simply make a commitment to do what's expected of you. Enjoy yourself this evening, secure in the knowledge that you've fulfilled your obligations.
 ----- 
 This is a good day to make your list and check it twice, Taurus. There is room for improvement in the way you organize your life. Your system at home, such as it is, isn't particularly efficient. Your bill paying is haphazard, and you may be surprised by how much you pay in late fees. Your in
 ----- 
 You're at risk of feeling emotionally overwhelmed today. Don't worry, Gemini, it will all work out. Take some deep breaths and apply your intellect to the situation. Prioritize and organize. You will find that steadily and systematically you can conquer your obligations. Take time off to pay attention to your family. You deserve some quality time.
 ----- 
 You can expect to receive some good financial news today, Cancer. Your mind races a mile a minute as you strategize ways to spend the money. If you aren't careful, you will have the money spent before the check has even cleared! Why not divide the funds in half? You can invest half in a low
 ----- 
 You might be surprised by how clever and creative you are today, Leo. Just for fun, you may decide to pick up a paintbrush and try watercolor painting or perhaps writing some poetry. Whatever you attempt, you can be fairly sure that it will work out favorably. Your creative muse is there on your shoulder and waiting for you to make use of her!
 ----- 
 Today you feel a tug of war between desires and obligations, Virgo. If you're smart about managing time, maybe you can satisfy both. You could be discouraged by how hard you've been working for minimal results. Take heart. You're accomplishing more than you realize. Your strong work ethic is what keeps you from having fun. Everyone needs some downtime. Work hard and then indulge your need to play.
 ----- 
 You need to give yourself more credit, Libra. When you set your mind to something, no matter how ambitious, you usually accomplish it. Remind yourself of this today, as you may feel bogged down and overwhelmed by obligations at work and home. Pay attention to your finances. All signs indicate that you may have inadvertently let a bill or other obligation slip through the cracks.
 ----- 
 Today you're bursting at the seams with energy and enthusiasm. Your personal and professional lives are going well, so it's no wonder you feel joyful. The only downside is that you may be overwhelmed by work responsibilities. Certainly there's a lot to do, but you're up to the task. Buckle down and put in a last burst of effort so you can enjoy your evening free of guilt.
 ----- 
 Take care not to get on a soapbox today, Sagittarius. You have strong opinions on everything from religion to politics. You risk offending people if you expound on them. You'd be better off keeping your views to yourself. In fact, rather than try to change people's minds with words, why not try and do it with actions? Set the right example. It's often a more effective form of persuasion.
 ----- 
 Friends and money rarely mix, Capricorn. Today a close friend may ask for a loan. Think carefully. Rather than take the easy route and say yes, you and your friend would be better served if you helped him or her figure out a way to earn the money. Perhaps you could offer a job or introduce your friend to someone else who can help. Be creative and you will find a solution that works for everyone.
 ----- 
 Today could be filled with delays and mix
 ----- 
 You have big plans, Pisces, and your dreams may be keeping you from paying attention to your work. Don't get too stressed. You've never missed a deadline, so you know that one way or another you will get everything done. In the meantime, begin to make plans for your next getaway. Plaster your office with photos of exotic locations to satisfy your wanderlust for the time being.
 ----- 
 This may not be the most energetic day, Aries. You've been working hard lately and your body needs time to refuel. Spend some quiet time at home. Curl up with some tea and a good book and let your mind travel where it may. Even though your body slows, your mind is more active than ever. This would be a fruitful time to strategize creative changes you'd like to make at home or work.
 ----- 
 Take care that you don't spend beyond your means, Taurus. There's no doubt about it 
 ----- 
 Today is a good day to join a group that shares your interests, Gemini. You will find comfort in numbers, as well as some real intellectual stimulation that comes from discovering new things with like
 ----- 
 You have a sharp, inquisitive mind, Cancer. Today you're likely to put it to good use exploring some arcane fields. It's likely your chief area of interest is scientific. You will find that if you get online, your research will be particularly fruitful. See if you can link to university sites for some real high
 ----- 
 The astral configuration indicates that you can expect a financial windfall of some sort, Leo! This is great, but don't celebrate just yet. While it seems likely that your income is going to increase through a raise or bonus, there are signs that the money isn't immediately forthcoming. Continue to live as usual, though with the satisfaction of knowing that things are going to improve soon.
 ----- 
 Love and romance are in the air, Virgo. The flame is going to be turned up a bit in an existing relationship. Perhaps you and your partner have been in a rut lately. Today you may see your friend in a new light. Your sweetie may do something unexpected like send you flowers or romantic email messages that open your eyes to who this person really is. You remember again why you fell in love.
 ----- 
 You have a creative soul, Libra, and today it's working overtime. You can't stop all sorts of imaginative ideas. Even if you've never written fiction, today you will have many clever ideas for stories and screenplays. Jot them down because they aren't likely to stay in your head for long. Refer to them later when you have some time to capture their essence more fully.
 ----- 
 If you've been feeling like you want to do more to help the world, Scorpio, today is the day to put those thoughts into action. There is a lot you can do locally. Sign up to help out one morning per week at a soup kitchen, or volunteer to help a child learn to read. By touching the life of just one person you have an impact on many. Don't discount the power of a single act of generosity.
 ----- 
 If you've had a longstanding interest in film or photography, today is a good day to explore that interest further, Sagittarius. You will likely receive an opportunity to learn some of the intricacies of the craft. Who knows? Maybe you will decide to go into the business professionally. If this is your true love, you should find a way to incorporate it into your life in whatever way possible.
 ----- 
 You may need to take the day off to replenish your soul, Capricorn. You've been working exceptionally hard lately. While your output is impressive, it's coming at a high personal cost. Take some time today to let your mind and body rest and relax. Cuddle up in your favorite chair with a book, some tea, and a quilt. Let your mind wander. You may be surprised where it lands.
 ----- 
 Pay attention to your dreams today, Aquarius. They're likely to be interesting! If possible, write down your impressions the moment you wake up. They may not mean much at first, but after a few days you can review your notes and you may be surprised by what they reveal. You're in the mood for a major change in your life, and your dreams may point you in the right direction.
 ----- 
 You may feel great about yourself, Pisces. It's no mystery why. You're looking better than you have in months. People are responding to you very favorably. You will get some admiring glances as you walk down the street. You can't help but draw attention to yourself. Your good feeling applies not only to you but also to those around you. Your loved ones are especially dear to your heart right now.
 ----- 
 A scandal concerning a celebrity you admire could be in the news today, Aries. This might throw you for a loop. You might even suffer some disillusionment. Withhold judgment for the time being. Much of what you hear may be traced to gossip or misinformation. Shocking though it may be, you will want to hear the celebrity's side of it. Only then can you form an objective opinion.
 ----- 
 Some rather shocking news could come to you from a friend who lives far away, Taurus. This probably won't affect you directly, as it most likely concerns the world economy, politics, or big business, but you still might worry about its long
 ----- 
 A dip in the stock market might cause you to worry about your own financial future, Gemini. You may have some investments that could be temporarily negatively affected. Bear in mind that such events don't necessarily reflect future trends. Take steps to create some kind of safety net if you wish, but don't assume the worst. The market could go back up tomorrow!
 ----- 
 Today you might find that some of your more ambitious plans finally seem to be paying off, Cancer. You should be happy about this, but you might panic a bit, fearing that everything could crash at the last minute. Don't assume the worst and don't waste your energy worrying. Keep striving! You've gotten this far. With a little effort, all should go well.
 ----- 
 If you've been doing some creative or job
 ----- 
 A project of some kind you've been working on could be going well, Virgo, but today you might experience a sudden rush of inspiration that makes it a lot better than you originally envisioned. This could involve effort that seems intimidating at first, but the results should be worth it. Summon all your energy and determination and get to it. You will be very glad you did!
 ----- 
 A family member could be experiencing business difficulties, Libra. Your sensitivity could cause you to feel their anxieties, too. You might want to make it clear to this person that you're there for him or her, but you also need to be objective about the situation. Protect yourself psychically, perhaps by surrounding yourself with white light. It won't help your relative if you're stressed.
 ----- 
 A friend or relative could be ill, out of work, or otherwise beset by problems. You may want to do whatever you can to help out. This could be frustrating, but you will feel better for having done what you can. This person needs to face and deal with his or her responsibilities. They're out of your control to fix, Scorpio.
 ----- 
 An unexpected expense, perhaps requiring repairs to the house or car, might take a chunk out of your bank account, Sagittarius. This may be disheartening. You've worked hard for your money and now you might have to put some of your plans on hold. Still, you need to be philosophical about it. Take care of it and move on. You built up your bank account once and you can do it again.
 ----- 
 Career changes may be on the horizon, Capricorn. Although positive in the long run, the events leading up to the change may seem catastrophic. Your employer could go out of business or move too far away for you to commute. The secret here is not to panic. Accept the situation and move on. In the end, you will probably be glad that this happened. Success and good fortune are coming.
 ----- 
 Premonitions today might be rather disturbing, Aquarius, and you might actually feel some fear because of them. Don't panic! Your intuitive abilities aren't quite as sharp as usual. What you feel could be distorted or untrue. This doesn't mean you've lost it, either. Try to be objective about everything you pick up psychically. You will be glad you did.
 ----- 
 Changes within a group you're affiliated with might profoundly affect you today, Pisces. Perhaps the group is veering in a new direction that doesn't particularly interest you. You might need to reevaluate your involvement. This could make you rather sad since you've grown fond of the people and won't want to lose them as friends. You need to think. Only you can decide what to do.
 ----- 
 An unexpected but welcome financial windfall could lead to some long
 ----- 
 You're looking great today, Taurus! A current or potential love partner who lives nearby is likely to be all too aware of this. Your heightened sensuality should be very apparent! A long walk with your friend could involve conversation that brings you closer together. You might spend most of the evening together. Expect a lot of kissing and handholding 
 ----- 
 Your aesthetic sense may increase, Gemini, leading to the discovery of an artistic talent you may not have known you had. You could decide to develop this talent, possibly by enrolling in a class. A current or potential love partner might decide to come with you, creating a new venue for bringing you closer together. This should prove very exciting.
 ----- 
 A social event, possibly involving a group you're affiliated with, could put you in touch with a lot of friendly, intriguing people who share your interests, Cancer. Among them could be a potential romantic partner, or a current partner could accompany you to this event. Whichever it is, both of you are likely to feel good about the event and will probably want to see your new friends again.
 ----- 
 You could be introduced to a celebrity you admire, probably a woman, perhaps at a lecture or book signing, Leo. This could make a profound difference in your life, as this person may inspire you. A romantic partner could meet her as well, and the two of you should have a lot to discuss over dinner. Relax and enjoy your evening. It could change your life in a very subtle way.
 ----- 
 A social event that involves the discussion of intellectual topics could occur today, Virgo. You could decide to go with a love partner. You're likely to enjoy the gathering so much that you may stay late into the night and then spend another hour or so discussing it with your partner. Afterward, anything could happen! In the future you will remember tonight as magical. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Some intense communication could take place today between you and a love partner, possibly about your future together, Libra. It's likely to lead to some positive developments in your life, possibly including a move to the next level of commitment. If you aren't involved now, a friend could introduce you to someone new, perhaps at a social gathering. Look your best throughout the day!
 ----- 
 Today you may feel especially sensual and passionate, Scorpio. This is the perfect evening to schedule quality time with a current or potential love partner. You're probably looking and feeling attractive, and this fact isn't likely to be lost on your friend. Scatter some pillows, add some flowers, put out some cheese, fruit, and white wine, and be prepared for anything!
 ----- 
 A social event or gathering that involves work could put you in touch with interesting people, Sagittarius, including a sexy potential love partner! Someone new on the scene could stir your blood like it hasn't been stirred in a long time. Whether or not you choose to pursue this attraction depends on your situation, but at least you will have some fun today.
 ----- 
 A new or long
 ----- 
 Today you should feel especially sensual, Aquarius. You will want to bask in the pleasure of being in love. A passionate encounter could occur at your home, probably after a wonderful meal you've prepared. You could have a frank discussion about the future of the relationship. You might decide to try living together if you don't already. Think carefully about it and do what feels right.
 ----- 
 A warm, interesting phone call from a current or potential love partner could have you longing for this person's company, Pisces. You should have a lot to say to each other and so spend a lot of time on the phone. A meeting could be arranged, probably somewhere in your neighborhood. Your chemistry is intense, so don't be surprised by the direction of this involvement.
 ----- 
 Discussions with friends or colleagues about possible future business enterprises could find you taking notes, Aries. Your natural meticulousness should serve you well. It will be important to have accurate records to discuss later. Any new project begun now is likely to succeed, especially if writing, speaking, or another form of entertainment is involved. Don't worry about possible failure.
 ----- 
 Today everyone will notice how attractive, articulate, and charming you are, Taurus. This is an excellent time to invite friends over or go out with them. Romance should go particularly well. In the course of your conversations, you might become aware of some fascinating and useful information that sparks you on to new interests and possibly new opportunities. Hold onto them and take the next steps.
 ----- 
 Whether or not you're artistic, Gemini, inspiration for music, painting, writing, or other creative projects could come to you thick and fast today. Write down your ideas. There could be so many you may not be able to remember them all. You will definitely want to draw upon them later. At least one could involve a new business enterprise with a partner. Take notes and do your research.
 ----- 
 A group activity could involve a number of people, including some close friends, who share your intellectual, philosophical, or spiritual interests, Cancer. A romantic partner could choose to attend this occasion with you. The conversation is likely to be so stimulating that your mind could spin. Walk home if you can. You will want to clear your head so you can sleep.
 ----- 
 Today you might be in the public eye along with some close friends and perhaps a love partner. You may be giving a speech, leading a discussion group, or be the center of attention at a party. You're likely to hold those around you spellbound, as your oratorical capabilities are very high. Enjoy the attention and make sure you give back what you get.
 ----- 
 A new and exciting person, possibly someone from a distant state or foreign country, could come into your life today. You could spend hours talking. The conversation could make you aware of new fields of interest that you find fascinating. Whether or not you pursue this attraction depends on your situation, but at the very least you will enjoy yourself!
 ----- 
 Some unusual dreams could have unexpected side effects, Libra. They could spark new ideas for creative projects or possible innovative concepts to advance your career or social life. They might clue you in to what's in the hearts and minds of those closest to you. Your dreams might say a lot about you. Write them down so you can analyze them. You might be surprised by what they bring to mind.
 ----- 
 Social contact with new and exciting people, Scorpio, perhaps at a neighborhood gathering, could bring intriguing information your way. You could learn about new fields that interest you. There's a possibility of a new potential romantic partner with whom you talk for hours. Whether or not you choose to pursue this depends on your situation. At least you will have fun today.
 ----- 
 Work might take up a lot of your time today, Sagittarius, perhaps job related, perhaps chores around the house. Friends or family may join you, and their conversation could help relieve some of the tedium. Getting the tasks done could free up the rest of the day for socializing, perhaps getting together in the evening with a love partner.
 ----- 
 Much of your day is likely to be spent in the company of family, close friends, and a current or potential love partner, Capricorn. Business partners could be involved. This should be a very pleasant, stimulating day for you. People you care about and enjoy will surround you. You're also likely to become more strongly bonded to a romantic partner.
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to host a social event in your home, perhaps for friends and colleagues with whom you share intellectual, philosophical, or spiritual interests. Dreams, astrology, or metaphysics could come up. This should be a congenial gathering. You're apt to bond closely with these people. At least one of them might be a potential romantic partner who finds you fascinating.
 ----- 
 A large gathering, perhaps a festival of some kind, could take place in your neighborhood today, Pisces. You could choose to attend with some close friends and your romantic interest. This event could shake everyone up a bit. It could present information that's exciting but also a bit unsettling. It could provide you and your friends with conversation for several days.
 ----- 
 It's certainly clear that you have faith in your actions, Aries! You feel no fear or doubt as you progress toward your goals, cruising along on calm seas under clear skies. This new atmosphere is likely the product of your renewed commitment. Reward yourself for your accomplishments, by all means, but you should wait a few days before launching a full
 ----- 
 This is a moment to start being creative in your life and stop being afraid of not having any talent. Who's to say what talent is? And in the romance department, the love of your life might be right in front of you. Try lifting your eyes from the romance novels and look around, Taurus. The perfect mate could be any number of people in your daily life. You just have to let yourself see.
 ----- 
 You may be a bit unclear about your professional direction today, Gemini. Your motivation has disappeared without warning. What happened? It may be that you need to become involved in projects that have more universal resonance. Projects of a narrow scope that concern only your interests no longer hold your attention.
 ----- 
 It could be that you see mirages, Cancer, most notably in the environment around you. You may have the impression that people are lying to you or hiding something from you. Or it may be you're the one who lies about certain things or hides what you do. Why are you making things so complicated? Don't be afraid to express your feelings today.
 ----- 
 Hold tight to your money, Leo, because you may have some strange {though noble) impulses to give it away or spend a large amount on something completely useless. You should think about spending your money in a better way or, better yet, not at all. Why not consider donating some time rather than money to those in need?
 ----- 
 Today isn't a good day to sign contracts or make any substantial purchases. Go to the grocery store, by all means, but buy hamburger not tenderloin. Keep your money in a safe place and save your reserves. Don't negotiate anything today, Virgo. No matter how good the offer sounds or how compelling the deal, just walk away.
 ----- 
 Are you certain that you can't modify your current situation, Libra? Are you a prisoner of a lifestyle that isn't of your own making or that may be a throwback from the past? People have been asking you to take on too many responsibilities and this is what weighs you down. Don't be afraid to be alone and distance yourself from these situations. Learn to say no and make your own life!
 ----- 
 The forecast for you is excellent, Scorpio. You can rely on today's aspects to restore your confidence, which has been sorely tried in the past few days. The warrior of seduction within you can swagger forth, certain of conquest. However, don't go too far. Wait a few days for reality to dispel the cloud of ecstasy and you will be able to see the future more clearly.
 ----- 
 You may have some trouble communicating today, Sagittarius. It's as though something is distorting your perception. Don't be surprised if, once evening comes, you feel like forgetting about all of your responsibilities and traveling to the other end of the world. Tomorrow you will see clearly again, but doubtless there are adventures in store for you!
 ----- 
 You're radiant and glowing with happiness today. This is a refreshing change after the gloom and doom of the past few weeks. Apparently the decisions you made worked out for the best. Or, even better, perhaps you're in love? In any case, Capricorn, it will be even easier than usual for you to communicate with others and share your joy. Let the good times roll!
 ----- 
 Your goal for the day seems to be to enchant your mate. There's no reason not to try. Indeed, today is excellent for love. But don't exaggerate your romantic wiles, Aquarius. Since the day's aspects tend to distort your perception of things, you may be betrayed by what you see in the mirror. Be careful of what you do and how you do it!
 ----- 
 You're in splendid shape today, Pisces! Did a fairy godmother conjure away all the little difficulties of the past few weeks? Enjoy this moment of relief from your worries. As for your love life, some exciting opportunities may arise. Be on the lookout for them, and whatever you do, don't let them escape!
 ----- 
 The outlook for today is excellent, Aries. The current alignment of the planets and the somewhat oppressive atmosphere of the past few days inspire you to change your surroundings and visit new places. Why not plan a little trip? All signs indicate that now is the best time for such an adventure. If you delay, you will feel stuck in the same old routine again.
 ----- 
 This will be a day rich in reflection, Taurus. You're able to observe what is going around you while still retaining your distance. Other people's ambitions will seem amusing to you as they play their parts more like caricatures than real people. Stepping back like this does you good. You should do it more often.
 ----- 
 Some long
 ----- 
 You have a day of profound reflection ahead. While you may be tempted to think about how far you've come, your time would be better spent thinking about what the future holds. You've entered a period of rethinking your identity and objectives. These aren't small things. You will need every ounce of energy at your disposal to make it through this time of transition.
 ----- 
 This would be an ideal day to take extra good care of your body, Leo. Don't kid yourself that those back problems will just go away 
 ----- 
 You may have recently modified the material aspects of your life. Was it sufficient to stop there? More profound changes might be in order. Take a look at what motivated you to create the life you live now. Pay special attention to the choices you've made in your professional life. Are you sure you're doing what you were meant to do? Are your talents being used to their fullest?
 ----- 
 This will be a great day to meditate, Libra. You may be a bit dissatisfied with yourself because your various projects have yet to take form. You're impatient, but who wouldn't be? This waiting period has lasted for about two months, but will soon end. The planets ask you to consider only what is essential. Don't allow yourself to start new projects based on anything superfluous.
 ----- 
 It's an excellent day, but be careful not to go overboard. You might be tempted to think that minor financial difficulties are already behind you. Alas, they are not. What you do today provides the blueprint for your future. Continued efforts to stabilize your behavior will provide the future security you desire.
 ----- 
 You're in the home stretch now, Sagittarius! Kiss your worries goodbye. Your efforts pay off in spades as people listen to your advice and bend over backward to please you. Although certain details in your love life still need ironing out, it's safe to coast for a while. You've spent months in this process of self
 ----- 
 Your life certainly seems to revolve around human contact. You're an outgoing, cheerful, engaging conversationalist who enjoys bringing people together, though lately you've been yearning to be alone. Capricorn, don't ignore any urge you feel for solitude. Even though it's an unusual need for you, it's still a valid one.
 ----- 
 Sometimes friends become a person's real family. Your friendships are deep and enduring. Many people are eager to give you help today, so why are you reluctant to receive it? Haven't you been the one promoting the benefits of warm, sincere friendship? The day ahead makes you aware of your talents and reinforces just how important such friendships really are.
 ----- 
 You've made it over the hump, Pisces. You've moved beyond the problems of the recent past and are entering a more peaceful phase. You will complete your projects at work, and your domestic life will be the picture of bliss and harmony. Enjoy this period of rest and relaxation. It will soon be followed by a period of intense longing requiring your total attention.
 ----- 
 Some of your job responsibilities are too much for one person and they might weigh you down today, Aries. The pile of work seems to get steadily bigger no matter what you do. Delegate if you can. Put the least urgent tasks aside and work your way steadily the rest. Your employer may or may not expect too much of you, but you're entitled to your sanity no matter what.
 ----- 
 A sudden fascination with metaphysical or spiritual concepts could have you wanting to read as much as you can on the subject, Taurus. Your enthusiasm could lead you in a dozen different directions, which could eventually lead to mental overload. It might be a better idea to take one subject at a time than try to learn about them all at once. Stay focused!
 ----- 
 A business enterprise with a friend might seem a little shaky today, Gemini. You could alternate between enthusiasm and gloom regarding this project. It's probably a good one and could lead to the success you want. Don't make any negative judgments about its future based on what happens today. All should be progressing again within a few days. Hang in there!
 ----- 
 A business deal that you may have been working to finish could require you to tie up a lot of loose ends today, Cancer. You might be pulled in a lot of different directions. Don't panic! Get some help if you can. Make a list of what you have to do and cross each task off as it's completed. Stay focused and all should go well. You will achieve the results you want.
 ----- 
 Accomplishing some important business might require touching base with many people who live and work far away, perhaps in other countries. This might require that you spend a lot of time on the phone, and it also would require allowing for the different time zones, which could be a drag. You will eventually make the contacts you need, even if they don't come until tomorrow.
 ----- 
 If you've been thinking about investing, Virgo, this isn't the day to commit to anything. This is a great day to consider your options, study economic trends, and analyze what you want from investing. It isn't a good day to hand over the money. Land could be a strong possibility. Consult with professionals, read the papers, and look into all kinds of opportunities before committing to one.
 ----- 
 Working at home could be difficult today, especially if you're finalizing a business deal, Libra. Other household members will be coming and going, slamming doors, asking questions, bringing their friends in. If you're doing household chores, forget it for now and return to it when it's quieter. If you're approaching a deadline, close the door and tell others to leave you alone for a while.
 ----- 
 Today you might feel the urge to get all unfinished work done, Scorpio. You could suddenly be in a frenzy to work quickly but perhaps not as conscientiously as you should. You may spend a lot of time going through paperwork and discarding what's outdated. It might be a better idea to slow down a little and look closely at what you're doing. You won't want to throw out something you may need later.
 ----- 
 A sudden burst of inspiration for a creative project might keep you busy in the morning and afternoon, Sagittarius. You will need information and materials you don't have at home, and finding them might require a larger expenditure of time, energy, and money than you initially thought. Don't give up on the idea. It's likely to be a good one and you will definitely want to pursue it.
 ----- 
 Too many people may be vying for your attention today, Capricorn, both at work and home. You will want to make them all happy, so you may feel a little frazzled. Your temper might also be on edge. It would be better to put off the less urgent demands than work yourself into a frenzy. Those who matter would rather have you enjoy life than tire yourself out for their sake.
 ----- 
 Communications coming your way today may be more plentiful than useful, Aquarius. You could receive lots of confusing phone calls. At first you will be excited by the mailbox full of letters, but then you'll find that some are junk while others are addressed to people you've never heard of. Hang in there. This tendency should pass by tomorrow!
 ----- 
 A friend may ask to borrow some money today, Pisces. You may feel that he or she is asking for more than is really needed, and certainly more than you're willing to give. You might think this puts you in an awkward position. Try to talk to your friend and explain your situation. If you have to say no, just say it. A real friend will understand and look elsewhere for the money.
 ----- 
 It's OK to cry today, Aries. Releasing is critical to receiving. If you have no sense of fear and restriction, it may be hard for you to experience joy and expansion. Incorporate the good with the bad and let these two powers settle harmoniously within your being. Make the preparations that will let you soar to great heights. Make sure you're ready to accept the challenges that come with growth.
 ----- 
 Do something that inspires the passion within you, Taurus. Don't be discouraged by setbacks 
 ----- 
 Take control of your power today, Gemini. Strip any excess baggage out of your life. Things are coming to a critical climax now. This isn't a time to back down. If anything, it's a time to push the limits even further. Look to the future with the same perspective you had as a child. Rid yourself of jaded thinking and a clouded mind.
 ----- 
 There's a powerful force moving through your life that can't be ignored any longer, Cancer. Adjustments may be needed in order to take full advantage of the energy at hand. You will find with a healthy balance of restriction and expansion that you can take the reins and set yourself on the road to success. There's a great intensity to today that will seep into every facet of your life.
 ----- 
 Seize today, Leo. This is the day you've been waiting for. Don't back down from the intensity. You have the power to get ahead in whatever it is you wish to accomplish in this lifetime. You will find your willpower and discipline strong. It's time to grab the opportunities that are presented to you. Take the plunge toward a brighter future and be confident of your success.
 ----- 
 Your quest for the new and unconventional, the latest gadgets, and the best technology may come into conflict with a sobering force today, Virgo. New ways of doing things may suddenly be challenged by a more traditional approach. Realize that the opposition's strength may also be its biggest downfall. It's time to do away with the old and bring in the new.
 ----- 
 For dreams to be actualized, they must have a vehicle through which they can manifest, Libra. Today is a day to help bring those dreams to life. Use the incredible grounding force to simultaneously expand your mind and bring it down to Earth in a realistic manner. Combine ancient wisdom with practical planning to help set a powerful wave in motion for the future. You have all the tools you need.
 ----- 
 Combine your discipline and expansiveness today and see what manifests. Concentrate on your investments and home. The energy of the day is quite powerful and not something to be taken lightly. You may have much greater control than you realize. Understand that you have to be the one to take the initiative in order to activate the magic of today.
 ----- 
 This is no ordinary day for you, Sagittarius, certainly not one in which you should sleep late. Get up and get moving. There are opportunities on your doorstep just waiting for you to grab them. Put away the issues of the past and focus on the future. There are great forces at work today that are coming together in your favor. Stick to what resonates with your soul.
 ----- 
 Ground yourself today, Capricorn. Lay a solid foundation for the future. This is a very critical time in which you must think realistically about your future success. You must incorporate an element of restriction into your life before your dreams can actualize. Today is one of those days in which you can fuse a powerful combination of fantasy and reality in order to build success.
 ----- 
 Use your powerful sense of intuition today, Aquarius. Whether you realize it consciously or not, the oceans are creating a tsunami of power that won't be ignored. Make sure you're operating from a solid base before you extend yourself outward. Be careful of the rip tides. It may be fun to play in the waves, but this is one of those times in which you could easily get sucked out to sea.
 ----- 
 Respect your superiors today, Pisces. There's great wisdom to be learned, so keep your eyes and ears open. Hasty actions are bound to get you in trouble. Don't step blindly into situations. Make sure you have all the facts before you proceed. The information is out there, but you have to be patient to find it. Make sure your goals are worthy before extend yourself trying to reach them.
 ----- 
 Reconnect with your self
 ----- 
 Stay at home tonight and cook a delicious meal for you and someone you love, Taurus. You will gravitate toward beauty, both tangible and intangible. In fact, it might be a good day to go shopping, as long as you can control the urge to overspend. Don't let your self
 ----- 
 Today may seem like one of those days in which everyone but you has a perfect life, Gemini. Realize that no one has a perfect life. Everyone is plagued by demons of some sort. And it isn't wise to compare yourself to others anyway. The more you do, the more you simply set yourself up for failure. Find that sense of love and fulfillment within yourself.
 ----- 
 Today may be serious, Cancer, with clouds looming over your parade. Although the clouds are dark and threatening, that doesn't necessarily mean that rain will pour down. Things are about to climax in your life. Today's message is that you should find the beauty and sensuality in yourself and others and renew your enthusiasm and sensuality in each new day.
 ----- 
 Today is a terrific day for you, Leo. You have the chance to start over on many levels, especially romantic ones. Whether or not you're in a serious romantic relationship, you will find all your interactions with close friends and partners to be especially tender and meaningful. Strengthen your bond with the people around you and your inner core will be strengthened as a result.
 ----- 
 Things are starting to lighten up for you, Virgo, even though you may find your interactions quite heavy today. Don't run away from the feeling. More than likely it's a result of you or the other person consciously or unconsciously wanting to get closer and more intimate. Your sensitivity is heightened. Let yourself feel rather than think. It's a day for listening rather than talking.
 ----- 
 Today is a terrific day to let your sensitive, caring nature shine through fully, Libra. Surprise someone with roses and a candlelit dinner. Take care of the amenities like music and wine. It's also an excellent time to go shopping for yourself or others. Let romance lead the way. Your inner core will be fueled by your sensual relations with others.
 ----- 
 Turn over a new leaf with your loved ones today, Scorpio. Infuse something new into the relationship. Add a new wave of tenderness and sensuality to the dynamic. If something annoys you about the relationship, don't confront it abrasively and cause the other person's defensive walls to go up. Be tactful and loving in your approach and you will get the same in return.
 ----- 
 You're going to feel extra connected with the people around you today, Sagittarius. Go out and have a good time with loved ones. You will experience the oneness that comes when people acknowledge that we are all part of a whole. This will resonate loud and clear in your core today and you will be extra sensitive and emotional about anything said to you, positive or negative.
 ----- 
 There's an Earthy weightiness to today. You could feel like your relationships are in a difficult situation, Capricorn. Don't worry, because the clouds are going to lighten up tremendously after today. Put in your hard work now and do any last minute planning you feel is necessary before you're off and running. The starting gate is about to open.
 ----- 
 Your love, generosity, and sense of beauty are heightened today, Aquarius. If there's one thing you need to do, it's go outside and watch the sunset. The romantic, creative, and beautiful side of all things, including you, will resonate strongly and create a lasting bond with your inner core. Your sense of self will be restored through tender moments and sensual experiences.
 ----- 
 Let your guard down today, Pisces. Don't feel like you need to perform for anyone. Accept the notion that you're perfect the way you are. You don't have to prove your self
 ----- 
 It might take an extra few minutes to get out of bed today, Aries, but it will be worth it when you do. You will find that the more honest you've been with people, the more payoffs you will receive. Being dependable and trustworthy are key issues to focus on. Act strong and proud with regard to who you are and the rewards will come. Bring a certain amount of tenderness to all your actions.
 ----- 
 Don't try to fit into a mold you simply don't belong in, Taurus. You may have gone through a major transformation lately in which you went from being a square peg to a round peg. Other people might still be trying to push you into the square hole. Don't let them. Let people know that it upsets you not to be treated the way you want to be treated.
 ----- 
 There may be subtle messages in people's words today that you need to attend to, Gemini. Other people could be trying to send you hints in order to push your buttons. Confront them on this behavior. Don't ignore the subtleties in their voices. Tender, loving messages may be laced with thorns intended to provoke you. Don't let this action go unnoticed.
 ----- 
 Don't keep playing along with the games if you no longer want to repeat the same drama, Cancer. By placing yourself in a victim role, you're opening yourself up to manipulation and control by others. To stop the repetitive pattern, it's crucial for you to stand up and recognize that you have an important part in the healing process. Recognize that you have the power and courage to change.
 ----- 
 Today is excellent for you, Leo. You should be encouraged to take action in any artistic realm. Cook a scrumptious dinner and share it with a loved one. Give your heart a chance to speak and act on what it says. Your feminine and masculine sides are on the same page now. Take the opportunity to balance these two aspects. You're a magnet for love and romance.
 ----- 
 Go weed the garden, Virgo. If you don't have a garden, start one. It's important for you to get into the Earth today, so roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. Feeling a connection with the ground is an important step in manifesting your dreams. Buy some seeds, fertilizer, and a watering can. This is a great day to create a nurturing environment in which a seed can grow.
 ----- 
 There's great opportunity for romance today, Libra. Love the people you're with, but don't smother them. The more you loosen your grip on a situation, the more you will gain control of it. Cutting chains to the past is the first step in moving forward toward a goal. You might not realize how much a past situation holds you back until you make the effort to release it.
 ----- 
 The active and receptive natures of your being are coming together, Scorpio. There's a balance between these two aspects. You're able to attract the prosperity and love you desire by the way in which you handle yourself around others. Today is about the equilibrium between give and take. Make sure there's a healthy balance between you and your loved ones.
 ----- 
 Today is a fantastic day for you. Your sensual, caring nature will be appreciated, Sagittarius. Whether you actively pursue it or sit back and relax, you will receive the love and good fortune you desire. Your creativity is also at a peak during this time. You should take advantage of this energy and actively use your talent to create something beautiful and meaningful.
 ----- 
 Being married to someone for many years takes work, Capricorn. No one said it was going to be easy. Hollywood promotes a fantasyland that can make your life look drab and boring by comparison. Realize that your life can be good and interesting, too 
 ----- 
 Today is a great day to make your big move, Aquarius. If there's something in the love and romance department that you feel you need to act on, this is the day to do it. It's now or never. Approach all situations in a practical, caring manner. Plow forward with confidence and don't look back. Indulge in those things that give you pleasure. Get a massage or take a bubble bath tonight.
 ----- 
 Take your focus off you and concentrate on someone else for a day, Pisces. This doesn't mean focusing so the person will stop and pay attention to you. It doesn't mean getting their attention so that you have someone who will listen to you talk. Get someone's attention because you really want to hear what he or she has to say.
 ----- 
 Although you may pride yourself on your patience, Aries, this quality could be hard to come by today. It's possible that you've bent as far as you can and reached the breaking point. The final straw is about to be placed on the camel's back. Let loose the explosion of emotion called for by events. There's no use trying to maintain a saintly demeanor today.
 ----- 
 People could be exploding with rage all around, and you may wonder what the big deal is. If anyone is likely to have a level head through today's chaos, it's you, and this gives you a tremendous advantage in any situation. The beauty of it is that you should be able to use these situations to your advantage. You understand the different sides and you know how to make them work for you.
 ----- 
 The more you try to control others, the harder it will be to get what you want, Gemini. People with equally strong wills are making it known they won't be bullied by your manipulative behavior. If a straightforward approach doesn't work, let it be. Perhaps the situation wasn't meant to develop the way you wanted. Trust that things will work out for the best whether or not you get your way.
 ----- 
 You may join hands with a spokesperson who's willing to attest to your honesty and good nature, Cancer. This person is happy to step up and toot your horn for you. You've earned a space in the spotlight, so don't shrink into the background when your name is called. Graciously accept the praise you receive 
 ----- 
 You may get frustrated when people who've taken shortcuts gain on your position, Leo. You believe that hard work is necessary to get where you need to go. You aren't afraid to expend the blood and sweat needed for success. You've planned well and you're on track. Try not to get upset by others who take the easy route. They may seem like they're gaining on you, but you're light
 ----- 
 You may not realize the effect of your erratic behavior on other people, Virgo. They may try to understand your viewpoint, but at times it seems you're talking in riddles. Slow down and clarify your thoughts before you dictate orders to others. You have incredible power. Learn how to harness it and become a good leader so you can make the most effective use of the resources at hand.
 ----- 
 It may be best if you stay out of the line of fire, Libra. Don't get into others' battles. By choosing sides, you create enemies. Use your compassion to soothe the situation. Use your caring nature to put out the fire. Don't get sucked into the flames where you may add to the confusion. Your job is to stand aside. You can care about the outcome without throwing yourself in headfirst.
 ----- 
 Although your general mood is good, Scorpio, this doesn't mean your day will go off without a hitch. When it comes to projects and getting things done, you may be the one to take the lead. You're good at motivating the troops to move as a unified force. The one thing to be careful of is having selfish motives. If you don't consider the needs of others, there will be mutiny on your ship.
 ----- 
 Difficult situations may arise in which you feel like you're doomed no matter what you do. Finding a working solution seems impossible due to the egos of the people involved. Even if everything looks workable on paper, this is no guarantee that things will work out in real life. Be honest and practical and make it a point not to choose sides or be biased in any way.
 ----- 
 Be quick to point out when you see an injustice, Capricorn. If someone says something offensive or untrue, don't let it slide. If you do, you're just as much at fault as the person who committed the offense. When you know you're right, say so. It's important that others respect you. Your honest nature and good moral sense are important qualities and should be recognized accordingly.
 ----- 
 Your emotions may be erratic, Aquarius. You may want everyone to know what you're feeling and act out in an immature manner to get noticed. In a way, you feel like a kid who will do anything to get a parent's attention, even if the action is naughty. At the same time, you don't want to be seen as the bad kid. As a result, you may just mope until someone asks you what's wrong.
 ----- 
 You may be fidgeting, Pisces, given your general restlessness. You're anxious to get up and do some sort of song and dance, and yet you insist on waiting for the right time. Meanwhile, you're getting extremely anxious for your big moment. You're in charge of your own show. If you feel ready to go on, don't wait. Added anxiety will only cause you to forget your lines.
 ----- 
 There will be a lighthearted, almost silly energy in the air today, Aries. The Universe is encouraging you to give up your iron grip on that list of responsibilities and have some fun. Picture all the pressure you put on yourself as a ball and chain that you need to unshackle. There's no reason to take yourself so seriously all the time!
 ----- 
 Taurus, plans to attend a lecture may have to be postponed because someone who's going with you feels under the weather. Overindulgence in food or drink may be the reason. This could be something you've wanted to attend for a long time, so make sure you know when and where the event will take place again. Either that or ply your friend with antacids and go anyway!
 ----- 
 A desire to make a big purchase might tempt you to overextend your credit cards and clean out your savings, Gemini. You aren't usually one to act on impulse, so don't do it today. Make the purchase if you really feel you need it and it isn't going to cause any major setbacks in your financial situation. That way your pleasure in the item won't be offset by guilt.
 ----- 
 Home might be a lonely place tonight, Cancer. The other members of your household may be out or out of town. You might not feel up to any carousing, so you will probably choose to stay home and read or watch TV. However, your natural gregariousness could cause you to feel abandoned. Call a friend and talk for a while. That will make you feel more like yourself.
 ----- 
 Usually you're quite social, Leo, but today you will feel like nothing more than working alone. Notwithstanding your wishes, however, you might be plagued with phone calls, visitors, and people wanting advice or help. Don't fight it. Go with the flow. Take care of what you need to and then spend the evening alone. Everyone has days like this.
 ----- 
 Too much good food, good wine, and good conversation, Virgo? Not that any of this is undesirable, but you may be suffering from overload right now. Maybe you'd better get some rest and give your brain some time to sort through all the information you've taken in. Now you're probably having difficulty processing it all. Don't worry. In the morning you will be able to remember anything important!
 ----- 
 You usually don't mind being alone, Libra. In fact, you enjoy your own company. Tonight you're going to crave companionship. You could have an impromptu party in your kitchen, perhaps involving friends who are also business associates. Some fascinating conversations could take place about business and intellectual matters, as well as some deeper subjects that keep you thinking for hours or days.
 ----- 
 This is the day to listen and observe, Scorpio. There is a lot to learn from what's going on around you. You might be surprised at the impact of it. Too much talk now could prove fruitless and even set you back in some way, especially if talk is used to hide your insecurities. Keep your eyes and ears open. Tomorrow you can share what you learn.
 ----- 
 Are you going out tonight with friends who mean a lot to you, Sagittarius? You might be tempted to eat and drink too much and spend too much money. Usually you have a pretty strong stomach, but this isn't the day to overindulge in partying. Go out for a little while, but then invite your friends to your house for coffee. That way you will feel good about the evening when you wake up tomorrow!
 ----- 
 What's driving you today, Capricorn? Why do you feel an obsessive need to get all your work done at once? If you're trying to impress someone, there's no need. Others already hold you in high regard. If the project you're working on is urgent, get some help. Don't try to do it all yourself unless you want to be too stressed out to accomplish anything tomorrow. Talk about counterproductive!
 ----- 
 If you're attending a class tonight, do something frivolous for the rest of the day. Read romance novels instead of great literature. Otherwise, by the time you get to class you will already be suffering from intellectual overload and absorb very little of what you hear. Keep yourself hungry for knowledge until you get there. That way you will learn quickly and retain a lot.
 ----- 
 The desire to stay home alone and rest tonight might conflict with a need to go out with your friends, Pisces. You may be too stressed to put up with gossip or too much intellectual stimulation. Tell your friends you will go out with them another time. All signs indicate that this is the wisest course for now. Relax with some hot chocolate and a pile of movies.
 ----- 
 Has someone given you a chore to do and then taken off without giving you any instructions? It's no wonder you feel confused and frustrated! If there is no manual, and if no one else knows what's up, don't feel bad about letting it go until you're given proper coaching. It's more prudent to wait than do it wrong and have to do it again. Better safe than sorry.
 ----- 
 Staying indoors might not be the best thing today, Taurus. You might feel vague muscular aches and pains for which you can't find any reason. They could be the result of inactivity rather than any dysfunction. Get outside and go for a walk or jog in the park. This will get the endorphins going and wipe away the memory of how you felt earlier. Have fun!
 ----- 
 A family member may be absent without explanation, Gemini. This might worry everyone, and not without reason. It's best to stay calm and phone friends, colleagues, and anyone who might know where this person is. All is probably well. Your family member has probably been preoccupied and neglected to let anyone at home know what's going on. Hang in there!
 ----- 
 A sibling or neighbor might not feel very communicative, Cancer. It may seem that this person isn't behaving in their normal, friendly manner, but isn't sharing why. Give him or her a break. There may have been some upsetting news that your friend can't stop thinking about. By tomorrow they should be on the way back to their usual self. Be patient!
 ----- 
 Are you working on a project that requires a little ingenuity? If so, today you may draw a blank. No matter how hard you think about it, you can't come up with a good way to proceed. Perhaps it would be best to put it away and do something else for a while. Trying to force the issue will only reinforce the mental blocks. Relax and let it come naturally in its own time.
 ----- 
 Your intuition is operating at a very high level, Virgo, except where your family is concerned! No matter how hard you try, you can't seem to make sense of anything anyone says, let alone does. Don't make yourself crazy over it. Ask for explanations, then barring anything destructive or nasty, let them go their own way. Sometimes people just have to learn through their own experiences.
 ----- 
 Telepathic messages you get from a friend or relative could seem confused and garbled, Libra. This might bother you, especially if the person is normally practical and rational. We all have bad days. Try to observe their behavior and see if there are any warning signs of inner or outer crisis. If not, you may have to just let them be. You can't force another to ask for assistance.
 ----- 
 Are you upset over money, Scorpio? Try to be rational. Your concerns are probably far more negative than the reality of the situation. Be objective and go over your budget to learn the facts. By the time you cover everything, you should be more than relieved. It's nothing you can't handle easily. Put it behind you for now and go out with some friends.
 ----- 
 Some news about a major event could unsettle and confuse you, Sagittarius. There could be contradictory reports, and commentators may confound the issue even more. You're primarily concerned about how this will affect you. The answer is probably very little. The media are apt to blow it out of proportion because it's newsworthy. The truth will come out in a few days. Hang in there!
 ----- 
 Spiritual studies might seem fascinating and confusing, Capricorn. Are you reading a book whose author isn't clear? Perhaps this isn't the best work to bring you the information you seek. Ask friends to recommend better books. Make a trip to the library. See what's available online. There's no need to try to make sense of something that's confusing to begin with.
 ----- 
 Your intuition may guide you in a direction that seems at odds with what logic and practicality tell you, Aquarius. This could put you in a quandary. Should you try to be practical or should you follow your heart? Don't make the decision today. Ask friends for advice if you like, but wait a few days before making any irrevocable choice. The uncertainty should clear up before long.
 ----- 
 Family problems may have a friend or love partner feeling unsettled and helpless, Pisces. This person could have a few communication problems, especially if firmness is required. Don't get sucked into the situation. Just point out the facts and encourage your friend to consider every factor on its own merits. While you do this, you might have some insights into a problem of your own.
 ----- 
 An unexpected financial windfall could come your way today, Aries. You may stand there with an open envelope in your hand, unable to speak. Whether it's an unanticipated bonus, gift, or surprising stock dividend, invest the money wisely. You've spent a lot of money recently, and it would be good for you to begin to replenish the bank account.
 ----- 
 Even though you're slaving away at work, your mind is very much on romance. Passion is running high, especially yours, Taurus! If you already have a romantic partner, why not plan an intimate evening together? If you don't yet have someone special in your life, it's likely you will meet someone today or soon thereafter. Make sure you look your best at all times!
 ----- 
 If you had to score your life right now, it would have to be a perfect ten. You look great, your career is going well, and your domestic life is harmonious. Could there be anything more to life? Don't think so. You may receive news of more success at work when an important sale comes through or a project is successfully completed. You have much to celebrate, Gemini!
 ----- 
 You have a lot to celebrate, Cancer, especially where your love life is concerned. Today you may receive a communication from your loved one that makes you yearn for this person's company. You've been together a lot recently, attending many dinners and social gatherings, but you've had little one
 ----- 
 There's a lot of work to be done today, and much of it centers on finances. Whether you're working on budgets or investments, you will easily finish the task. Your trusty computer will help you as you discover a new website that supports your efforts or post a question in a financial chatroom that yields many responses. Favorable advancement is likely, Leo, if not today then quite soon.
 ----- 
 You may be privy to some information today that will ultimately result in financial gain, Virgo. You may get wind of a new company and be one of the first investors. Or perhaps what you hear gives you an idea for a new product that you bring to market yourself. The outlook for you is rosy indeed, although your success won't come without putting your own skills and talents to use!
 ----- 
 Expect to receive some great news today, Libra. Answer your phone and check email all day, because you never know when it will come. Indications suggest that success in all aspects of your life is coming. You may complete a project to acclaim or submit a report that's accepted without question. These small successes boost your self
 ----- 
 Your optimistic nature has served you well. This quality makes you a great manager since you can motivate and inspire co
 ----- 
 You woke up feeling happy and enthusiastic, Sagittarius. Your intuition tells you that you will achieve whatever you set your mind to. Whatever your goals 
 ----- 
 Whether you spend today with your feet on the ground or in an airplane, you're eager and enthusiastic about your life direction. If you aren't on your way to a distant land, it's likely that you will be airborne soon, Capricorn. You've achieved tremendous success lately and that trend is going to continue. If this trip is a reward to yourself for all of your hard work, you deserve it!
 ----- 
 Success and good fortune are strongly indicated today, Aquarius, along with a sense of optimism. All sorts of changes and surprises lie in store for you. You may receive information from a business partner that radically changes your short
 ----- 
 Money matters are highlighted today, Pisces. You can expect to spend a lot of time with the calculator as you balance your checkbook or begin to work on your budget. Even if you don't consider yourself particularly good with numbers, you will do a great job. You're conscientious. Success in all endeavors is indicated today.
 ----- 
 If you have to deal with some disappointment today, try not to let it get you down, Aries. You may receive a letter or phone call that brings less than favorable news. Perhaps someone you were hoping to see won't be able to make it, or a friend has to turn down an invitation to a party you're having. Try not to let this spoil your mood. These things happen. Keep yourself busy.
 ----- 
 You may be worried about your financial situation today, Taurus. You might feel a tug at your purse strings. If you've experienced a delay in receiving some funds you were expecting, this may add to your concern. You might want to tackle this directly by examining your situation. Check up on expected funds and make any necessary arrangements to alleviate this stress.
 ----- 
 An unexpected event might cause you to be temporarily separated from your partner today, Gemini. Confusion about the incident and your mate's role in it might plague you. You might doubt his or her motives. If so, it may be best to talk and clear up any suspicions. Letting such thoughts sit for even a short time can create challenges for a relationship. Deal with the situation now.
 ----- 
 You might have a sore throat and mild cold symptoms today, Cancer. It may affect your ability to work. Chances are that you're an active person. Having to slow down to tend to your health may frustrate you. Consider going to the doctor's office now rather than ignore your health. This could make all the difference in how long you stay under the weather and are kept from things you want to do.
 ----- 
 Spend some quality time with your partner today, Leo. Perhaps he or she is a little jealous of your friends or feeling left out. Perhaps you've received invitations lately that are just for you. It might be a good idea to turn one down in favor of being with your partner. Plan a romantic interlude. A little quality time can help get things back on track.
 ----- 
 You may want to take a day off from your obligations, Virgo, perhaps to take care of unfinished creative projects. Chances are this may not be possible. Concerns about work issues might keep your mind occupied and distract you from the task at hand. This and possible family disagreements may have you upset. Try to remain centered and focused despite it all. It's the only way to get anything done.
 ----- 
 You may reminisce today, Libra. Perhaps you're thinking about friends and family who live far away. You could feel a bit nostalgic, not to mention blue, thinking about times long past. Consider making some phone calls to counteract these feelings. If you can't connect with a particular person, spend a little time looking through a photo album to bring him or her closer to you.
 ----- 
 Money matters might be a bit tangled today, Scorpio. There may be an unexpected delay in receiving funds due you. Your bank statement may have you confused. Getting to the bottom of things may prove a bit frustrating but not necessarily impossible. If you find that you're uncertain about your financial situation, consider talking with those involved to get a better understanding.
 ----- 
 You may need reassurance today, Sagittarius. Trouble with friends or a romantic partner may have you feeling unloved, insecure, and emotionally blocked. You may see the situation as more serious than others do. Perhaps a misunderstanding has caused the dilemma. Take the time to reach out to those you're concerned about and get some reassurance. If you owe an apology, give it freely and move on.
 ----- 
 You may feel a little under the weather today, Capricorn. You may even develop sniffles or a sore throat. If so, consider going to the doctor. This can be an especially unwelcome development, as it keeps you from certain activities. If you act quickly, your ailment may not worsen. Take the time you need to feel healthy again before returning to your routine.
 ----- 
 You might feel lonely and insecure due to lack of contact with a close friend or romantic partner, Aquarius. You might wonder if the person has forgotten you or simply doesn't care anymore. Take the time to try to connect with this person. You may discover that no neglect was intended and that the relationship is solid. It's better for you to tackle this directly rather than speculate.
 ----- 
 Juggling work and home may seem difficult today, Pisces. Work responsibilities may weigh on your mind to the point where they interfere with the harmony of your home life. This can cause some inner conflict. It might be wise to prioritize work tasks on paper and schedule duties and deadlines. Then you can spend time with your family without worrying that work will be forgotten.
 ----- 
 Your creativity is at an all
 ----- 
 Your inspiration and creativity are high today, Taurus. If you've been thinking about taking up painting or poetry, this would be an ideal day to get started. Make sure your perfectionism doesn't get in the way of your creative urges. You can be a critical editor. For now, don't worry about the end product. If you enjoy the creative process, the end result will reflect your joy.
 ----- 
 It's bad enough having too many cooks in the kitchen, but when those cooks argue not only about how to cook the meal but also about how to design the kitchen, you know you have trouble on your hands. Tempers are likely to flare today. Everyone has an opinion about how you should decorate your home. Whoever pays the mortgage gets to make the final decisions. That should settle it.
 ----- 
 Your self
 ----- 
 You may feel some frustration over your perceived inability to reach an important milestone in your career. It's possible that you only need to reevaluate the benchmarks you've set in order to see that you've made more progress than you thought. Remember, ultimately, the time it takes you to reach a goal matters less than the fact that you reach it.
 ----- 
 Sometimes you can be too passive and let others trample all over you. Your lack of ego is admirable, but only up to a point, Virgo. Why let others take credit for your ideas? There could be a situation where you feel compelled to speak up. Protect your rights and defend yourself against an unethical person intent on downplaying your contribution. Hold your ground and you will be vindicated.
 ----- 
 An unethical acquaintance could be spreading unfounded rumors. Don't take anything you hear today at face value, Libra. Get all the facts before drawing conclusions. Equipment being installed or acting up adds to the confusion. If the situation weren't so frustrating, it would be comical. Take deep breaths throughout the day. Tomorrow things will be on a more even keel.
 ----- 
 A longtime friend may become something more today, Scorpio. It could be that there has always been a certain spark between you, but you haven't been able to acknowledge it until now. Make extra sure that the time is right, however. You don't want to hurt anyone else's feelings as you begin to explore the new aspects of this old relationship.
 ----- 
 You may be frustrated today, Sagittarius. An anticipated romantic encounter may be postponed or canceled. There's no reason to consider it a major setback in the relationship. If you feel doubt and uncertainty, it's likely for other reasons. You're agitated and not in a good place to make any sweeping judgments. Let your head clear for a few days and then plan the next steps.
 ----- 
 You could feel a bit low today due to disappointment in someone important to you, Capricorn. It could be that a mentor no longer supports you or perhaps an authority figure has shown his or her true colors. Rather than casting about for a new role model, why not follow the path that you know is right for you? You're experienced enough now not to need anyone else to lead the way.
 ----- 
 You're likely changing your mind about something that has been important to you, Aquarius. Perhaps you're questioning your job, career path, or choice of a mate. Confusion may dominate your thoughts today. Don't expect to arrive at any concrete answers by day's end. This is a situation that will only be resolved with time. Try to be patient.
 ----- 
 Romance is in the air today, Pisces. Alas, it seems to rain down on everyone but you. You must have put on your romance
 ----- 
 You aren't one to put much stock in the meanings of dreams, but you may have had a dream recently that was so accurate in its prediction as to be almost scary. Certainly it was uncanny. Write down everything you remember about it and then discuss the images with a friend. Don't worry, Aries, your friend won't laugh at you. It's more than likely you will receive some telling insights.
 ----- 
 You're peerless when it comes to your ability to sway others to your point of view, Taurus. Today you may be put on the spot and asked to defend a position in front of many people. You will do just fine, surprising everyone but you. You handle a microphone with ease and work an audience until they're putty in your hands. You could sell anything!
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if you get a sudden windfall today, Gemini. It may come in the form of cash. More likely it will be an opportunity of some kind. Perhaps a business partner has suggested you branch into a more lucrative area. Perhaps you decide to go into business for yourself. Whatever it is, you're bound to succeed. From business and creative standpoints, this is a most auspicious time for you.
 ----- 
 You have a quick mind, Cancer, which you don't use to anywhere near its full capacity. Think of your brain as a thoroughbred horse, trained to run at high speed. This type of animal is miserable if kept penned up, unable to run and stretch. Your mind needs similar room to stretch and grow. If new challenges don't come your way, you may have to create some of your own. It's a shame to sit idle.
 ----- 
 A day off is just what the doctor ordered, Leo. Try to get some rest. Spend time curled up with a good book. Only go out with friends if you're feeling absolutely stir crazy. You should do no work. Your body and spirit crave a break. Take care of your basic need to refresh yourself. Everything else will fall into place afterward.
 ----- 
 With today's planetary energies, Virgo, you can expect a lot of contact with friends. In fact, just when you thought you'd never receive another invitation or attend another party, one comes your way. Even though you may feel partied out right now, resist the urge to decline. You're likely to meet a very interesting person at this next bash.
 ----- 
 You have a keen intellect and unparalleled persuasive powers, Libra. If you aren't an attorney, you should be. All signs indicate that your career is about to skyrocket. Career and financial success are pretty much guaranteed with today's planetary configuration. If you have a mate to share this good fortune with, consider yourself doubly blessed.
 ----- 
 Your mental powers should be especially acute today, Scorpio. Your mind will be quick and receptive and your communicative abilities exceptionally sharp. You feel on top of the world, as though you could sell anything to anybody! Make the most of this surge of intellectual power by beginning any new projects you've been considering.
 ----- 
 Your creativity will be high today, Sagittarius, inspiring you to paint or write. If you're unable to take time to satisfy your muse, at least take some small steps to ensure your abilities don't lie fallow. How about signing up for a class or joining a writing group? The ongoing contact and support will give your talents a big boost.
 ----- 
 Today you're going to want to shut out the world and be alone with your thoughts, Capricorn. You're caught up in the introspective energies at play. You may not be very cooperative, and may even wish to spend time on more solitary activities. Indulge yourself. You might want to take time alone to meditate. Listen to yourself. You're likely to be on the verge of a major self
 ----- 
 Today indicates that you can expect to make a leap in your career, Aquarius. Your intellect and communicative skills have served you well in the past months, paving the way for advancement. You may decide to try hard to be sure the promotion occurs. You might work extra hours and decide to commit to some new projects so the higher
 ----- 
 If you've been considering a career in writing or teaching, Pisces, this is an ideal day to put some plans into motion. Your imagination and inspiration are highlighted, as is your facility with words. This combination pretty much guarantees that you could sell anything to anyone. If you're ready to pitch a book proposal to a publisher, do it now.
 ----- 
 Books that you may have received as gifts could have you thinking deeply about spiritual or philosophical matters today, Aries. Your mind is quicker than usual, so you can probably grasp some rather complex ideas. Your practical side could bring up doubts as to the applicability of what you're learning, but don't worry about that. This should become clear to you eventually.
 ----- 
 Your level of physical and mental energy is high today, Taurus. You may have been overindulging in food and drink lately, and so you could spend much of the day working out at the gym. Take a good book to read in the sauna, because you will also want the mental stimulation. At the end of the day you will feel good about yourself and ready to overindulge some more!
 ----- 
 A memory, dream, vision, or meditation could trigger a rush of spiritual energy, Gemini. As a result, you might want to jot your experiences down so you won't forget them. Try not to dwell on it too much. This isn't the time to be reclusive! The process won't stop. The insights should continue to come. Keep up your studies and meditation and you will go on growing indefinitely.
 ----- 
 A message from a friend could make your day, Cancer. The good news may involve travel, money, or a love relationship. There could also be an intellectual matter that you're anxious to look into, perhaps for the purpose of writing or teaching. A journey, possibly related to education, could be in the offing, perhaps with friends. A busy and stimulating day is definitely ahead.
 ----- 
 The planetary energy leaves you in a contemplative mood, Leo. A lot of different possibilities have opened up for you recently, and you're trying to figure out which is the most appropriate now. Sometimes it's better to let things churn around in your subconscious for a while, and this could be one of those times. Forget it for now and have fun.
 ----- 
 Talk of traveling to distant and exotic places could come up at a gathering of family and friends, Virgo. Some of the talk is pure fantasy, but there are a few people among you who are genuinely serious about their plans. Are you considering going away for a while? If so, you might listen to what your friends have to say. It would certainly be fun if all of you went together!
 ----- 
 Career matters may be put on hold for a few days, Libra, but your professional future probably won't be far from your thoughts, even in the midst of time spent with family and friends. You want to improve your financial situation, and a number of possibilities have come up. Don't mull them over too much now. You don't want to neglect your loved ones. Relax and enjoy their company today.
 ----- 
 So many fascinating ideas have come your way over the past few days that your mind is spinning. Some of what you've heard could be so radical that it will take some time to make sense of it. You could also want to memorialize your thoughts, perhaps by making some notes or writing an article. Watching TV might get your mind off it all and help you relax a little. Go to it!
 ----- 
 A deep, intimate conversation could take place today between you and a romantic interest, Sagittarius. If this is a casual relationship, it may suddenly become more. If you're involved but not committed, you could reach an understanding. If you're already committed, there may even be talk of marriage. The end result of this conversation should be happiness for both of you. Celebrate tonight at home.
 ----- 
 This morning you may wake up from a dream with many inspiring new ideas. If you're into creative activity of any kind, you will want to jot these ideas down, as well as possibilities for bringing them to the rest of the world. This could be through music, painting, writing, or any kind of art form. Don't be surprised if your style changes a little. If nothing else, this demonstrates versatility!
 ----- 
 A few extra things need to be done around the house today, Aquarius. A few more letters need to be written, a few more cleaning chores should be done, and you might still want to dress the place up a little. Your mood is very positive, and you should speed through these tasks with little energy drain. You will have plenty left for socializing tonight.
 ----- 
 Children may be a part of your day today, Pisces. You might attend a party for children or a larger gathering that includes them. At some point you might even be telling them a story. This will probably be as much fun for you as for your audience, who are likely to be very appreciative. Don't be afraid to ham it up a little 
 ----- 
 You may be thinking about political or social matters today, Aries, specifically, the deterioration of the planet. You may be worried about your future and that of your children. You might try to bring up the subject at a social gathering. Someone you meet there is bound to teach you something about the issue. If you need to get further involved raising people's awareness of this issue, do it!
 ----- 
 Today is going to present not only a continuation but also an intensification of the strong energies that have been pushing you toward self
 ----- 
 Today you should be asking yourself a lot of important questions, Gemini. The Universe is pushing you on your journey of self
 ----- 
 If you're feeling unappreciated by the people around you, Cancer, try going somewhere else. Begging for attention is unattractive, and so is strutting around trying to distract everyone with your gorgeous physique or charming wit. Go where you know you're appreciated, where your stories will make people laugh, where you feel at home. Know that if you stay where you are, nothing you try will work.
 ----- 
 You could be in an uncomfortable situation with friends today, Leo. There may be gossip going around about a mutual friend and you will be tempted to join in. Remember that repeated stories are rarely completely true. You would hate to lose a friendship if he or she found out you said something unflattering. Be careful. The people you're gossiping with may gossip about you later.
 ----- 
 A close friend or colleague could receive special recognition for good works today. You're pleased with your friend's success, Virgo, and grateful for your own good fortune. It seems that you also have achieved a long
 ----- 
 You may have heard a juicy story about a friend lately and be just dying to share it with your entourage, Libra. Be careful with this impulse! The party in question would not appreciate hearing about what you're doing. You could unnecessarily harm someone's reputation. Think about how you would feel if the show was on the other foot!
 ----- 
 It looks as though your ship is about to come in, Scorpio. It's likely that you will receive a letter or call alerting you to good financial news. Your mind may immediately begin to spin with ways to spend this windfall. Take care not to go on any shopping sprees. If invested wisely, this money could last a lifetime.
 ----- 
 Today you may find all your recent efforts rewarded, Sagittarius. Your quick thinking and astute powers of observation have impressed others. Today you're likely to be recognized in some way. Don't be surprised if you end up in the spotlight, blushing at the acclaim. This is likely to give your confidence a big boost and cause you to consider other ways to advance your career.
 ----- 
 If you're a salesperson, Capricorn, expect orders to roll in today. You're unusually persuasive, making it virtually impossible for anyone to say no to you. All signs indicate you will be successful with whatever you undertake. Take advantage of this auspicious time. But be wary if you end up on the receiving end of a sales pitch. Opportunities that seem too good to be true usually are.
 ----- 
 This is a good day to spend with your family, Aquarius, as you love to do. Try to get chores out of the way as quickly as possible and schedule something fun for the afternoon. Maybe you would enjoy an outing to a park or movie. Perhaps it would be fun to bake cookies. Whatever you decide, warmth and love will permeate the air and bring you closer together as you create wonderful memories.
 ----- 
 Today's planetary energies may put spiritual matters in your mind, Pisces. You may not be thinking in religious terms. Your focus is likely to be on the state of humanity and what you can do to help others less fortunate. Make some calls or do some research online. Find out how you can get involved. If you're short on time, a monetary gift can help you feel more connected and peaceful.
 ----- 
 A discussion could take place in your home between you, friends, and household members, Aries. A love partner may also be present. The conversation will concern controversial issues that the people feel very strongly about, so expect to hear intense debate between opposing views. Your guests will take more of an intellectual than argumentative stance, so you can relax and learn. Have fun!
 ----- 
 There could be a meeting in your community regarding some extensive changes in the not too distant future, Taurus. The meeting could bring facts to your attention that you should be aware of. The changes are likely to be positive in the end, but now they could be disruptive for all. Listen carefully to what everyone says, think about it, and then determine your position.
 ----- 
 Career matters might prove frustrating today, Gemini. You're aiming for a specific goal of some kind that you're anxious to reach, but it seems to hit one setback after another. Hang in there! Persevere and keep pushing. Whatever it is you're trying to attain, you will get there. It's just going to require considerably more time and effort than you originally thought. Keep on pushing!
 ----- 
 A new field of interest may require much of your concentration for the next several days, Cancer. You could be studying a new spiritual discipline or perhaps an intellectual problem, such as the workings of the universe, or both. Your mind is especially sharp right now, so this is a good time to begin a new course of study. Take occasional breaks to avoid a sore back and eyestrain.
 ----- 
 Are you interested in psychology? If so, you might discover some information that clues you in to your mental and emotional history. Such disciplines as past
 ----- 
 Your circle of friends is probably changing, Virgo, perhaps too rapidly for your tastes. Some friends may be moving away, or different interests have caused you to form new friendships. Your life seems to be going well right now, but you may miss your old friends and go through temporary fits of nostalgia. Focus on the future and move ahead!
 ----- 
 Although things may be going well for you at work, Libra, it's probably taking a physical and emotional toll on you. You may suffer from mild stress
 ----- 
 Are you working on something that requires in
 ----- 
 Today, Sagittarius, you might feel caught between the determination to reach a certain goal, probably financial, and a desire to stay home and work on your own projects, take care of your family, or both. You're clever and resourceful enough to have it both ways. Friends who know the ins and outs might be able to help you along these lines. Think carefully! You may be surprised by what you learn.
 ----- 
 A social event could put you in contact with people who love to gossip, Capricorn. They might have some juicy tidbits to report, and you could be torn between curiosity and compassion for the person being discussed. If what you hear is good, relax and enjoy it. If it's vicious, don't be afraid to speak up. Someone has to express displeasure at the spreading of unkind rumors!
 ----- 
 Over the past few months you may have thrown yourself into your work, accomplishing feats that ordinary people would never even try. Today you should give your brain a day off! Don't worry. Your successes haven't gone unnoticed by higher
 ----- 
 For the past few days your mind has been primarily on the loftier side of romance 
 ----- 
 Your skills with computers and other forms of technology should be growing rapidly. This will greatly increase your efficiency with these tools and your marketability, should you be thinking of changing careers or simply be looking for a new position. This would be a good day to get your resume up to date so you can act when you learn of a job that seems right for you.
 ----- 
 You should feel especially strong, motivated, and focused, Taurus. Your ability to establish yourself in the world is enhanced by increased self
 ----- 
 Sudden positive developments regarding the family could make a big difference to your future if you make the most of them, Gemini. A family member could have a lucky break of some kind and need your support. You might be in the right place at the right time to meet the right person. These things can be wonderful, but they're fleeting. Take advantage of them now or they will disappear.
 ----- 
 You might want to leave the office early today to finish all those pressing errands, Cancer. Phone calls could keep you busy, as could small tasks that still need tending around the house. At some point, financial paperwork might take up a lot of your time, but the evening shows promise. Expect to receive visitors or make some visits yourself.
 ----- 
 A task that requires a lot of writing might have you discovering a new talent you never knew you had. You might be surprised, but you will want to develop this new skill. It could involve technology in some way, or it could entail working with money. A number of people could confer with you at some point during the day, Leo, perhaps asking advice about future business trends.
 ----- 
 A new piece of equipment could be delivered to the workplace and make you feel like you've received a new toy. Resist the temptation to spend the afternoon playing! You should be feeling especially playful right now, Virgo, so this is a good time to organize or attend a sporting event. Unusual happenings throughout the day could make your head spin, so you will need some fun in the evening!
 ----- 
 Emotional reunions with friends or relatives you haven't seen in a long time could take place today, Libra. Some of these might be unplanned and off the wall. You might meet your sixth
 ----- 
 A quarrel with a friend might put you in the position of having to lay all your cards on the table and tell him or her exactly how you feel. It isn't always easy to be so frank, Scorpio, but today the strength of your sincerity should impress your friend and make your friendship stronger. Your honesty can also prove beneficial when it comes to starting, working toward, or completing long
 ----- 
 A talent for writing that you haven't tapped may surface today, Sagittarius. Perhaps using a computer, particularly one with voice activation, is making it possible. Your imagination is in full swing, and your work may be very entertaining. If you've been thinking about writing, this is the day to start. It's also a good day to handle paperwork relating to finances. You should breeze through it.
 ----- 
 You could either be planning or preparing for a long journey by air, Capricorn. Your plans may still need to be confirmed. Today is the perfect day to do this. Spiritual matters might be very much on your mind right now, and you might read a lot about such subjects. Don't be surprised if it proves difficult to put them out of your mind.
 ----- 
 Unexpected social invitations might find you meeting people in the healing professions 
 ----- 
 The vast social whirl of late might have overwhelmed you with new names and faces, all of which you want to remember. Today would be a good day to follow up with some of them by phone, postcard, or email. Your charisma and sincerity are likely to have made just as much of an impression on them as they did on you, Pisces. Don't be shy.
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to sequester yourself at home, catch your breath, get your thoughts together, and recall the events of the past several days. You will also plan for the future, Aries, as you feel especially optimistic and energetic enough to pursue whatever goals you have. At some point you're likely to share this with a close friend and seek his or her support and opinion.
 ----- 
 Taking care of chores around the house might bring some home matters to your attention that need to be taken care of, Taurus.

 ----- 
 A group you're associated with but have been neglecting may be on your mind today. You might want to fulfill your obligations to it. You could also consider completing a long
 ----- 
 Money may be coming your way through a contract of some kind. This is a positive development. Make sure you read every word in the document before you commit to anything. This is a good time to ask for a loan or fill out paperwork regarding scholarships, grants, or other forms of financial support. The process is going to be less complicated than you imagined, Cancer. Things should manifest quickly.
 ----- 
 Are you sometimes afraid of appearing silly in front of people, Leo? The fear of failing in the eyes of others might be holding you back from real progress. The celestial energies are asking you to think about this carefully today. With all of your analytical strengths and abilities, just think of all that you could accomplish if you had the courage to take more risks!
 ----- 
 You usually like to think of yourself as being a scientific, logical person, Virgo, but today you may think more like a mystic. Your intuition is more active than usual, and you might come up with the same words as someone close to you. You might also feeling especially inspired to work in an innovative way. Use your intuition and go for it!
 ----- 
 Social invitations or opportunities to participate in group activities should come your way for a few weeks, Libra. Your phone could ring off the hook. Relations with others should be warm, friendly, and congenial, so any sort of get
 ----- 
 You're thinking about your future career development, Scorpio, and you aren't happy with your current situation. Advancement is on your mind. Perhaps you seek a promotion or you want another job or you prefer to change careers entirely. This is the time to get your head together and firm up your plans. Success is on the horizon, but only if you work toward it.
 ----- 
 Today is a good day to take time out for the small, sensual pleasures, Sagittarius. Perhaps this is a day for dessert, particularly chocolate or cheesecake. Don't forget about the pleasures that nature can bring. You may want to spend time in a park or forest or next to a lake, breathing in the fresh air and soaking up the beauty. You may also enjoy indulging in a massage.
 ----- 
 Some time alone with a special person is definitely called for today, Capricorn. The social whirl of recent weeks has put you in touch with a lot of old friends and enabled you to make new ones. Now it's time to relax at home. You might discuss your plans for your future together, perhaps regarding possible changes in your living situation. You might also give some thought to your career.
 ----- 
 The possibility of moving out of your neighborhood may have occurred to you before, Aquarius, but events today might have you finally making up your mind to do it. Perhaps too many good neighbors have moved away, or maybe some good fortune has made it possible for you to move to a bigger place. There is much to consider and decide before it happens, but if this is what you really want, go for it.
 ----- 
 Today you might be pleasantly surprised to realize that you're in far better financial shape than you thought. You could discover a hidden talent for money management that you didn't think you had. You might also be anticipating a raise or some other increase in income. Optimism and enthusiasm are what drive you today, Pisces. Your hopes for the future seem more grounded in reality than ever.
 ----- 
 Think of yourself as a great pioneer crossing the frontier for the first time, Aries. Acknowledge yourself as the important person that you are. Believe in yourself and your rights and opinions. Indecision could hinder your actions. Don't let it. Take an active stance at all times. Be brave in the face of hardships that you might confront today. You will be greatly rewarded when you do.
 ----- 
 Make sure you keep up your end of the bargain today, Taurus. People are counting on you whether you realize it or not. You may get the idea that you can sneak out of responsibility if you lay low and not say a word. The fact of the matter is that people are watching you and they will know when you haven't upheld your promises to the group.
 ----- 
 You may feel tension in your world today without really knowing why, Gemini. This feeling of conflict may have your stomach in knots, making it difficult to deal with anything or anyone in a rational manner. Try not to take everything personally when people disapprove of your actions. Their reaction is to your behavior, not necessarily to you as a person.
 ----- 
 Don't downplay your abilities now, Cancer. You're on the brink of greatness, so act like it. Things should go quite well if you let them. Don't clog up the works by thinking that you're unworthy of the good luck that is sure to come your way. If things don't work out exactly the way you want them to, take it as a sign that the situation wasn't right for you anyway.
 ----- 
 Take a leap of faith today, Leo. Consider taking two or three. Trust that things will follow through perfectly. You will be drawn to those who put a smile on your face. These are the people you need to stick close to now. A positive attitude will lead you in a positive direction. Have fun with your life instead of getting depressed by it.
 ----- 
 When others can't seem to decide which way to proceed, it will become crucial that you stand up and be the deciding force, Virgo. Be as aggressive as you need to be today in order to set things in motion. The elements are already in place. What's needed now is a bit of follow
 ----- 
 Your head may be going in a thousand different directions today, Libra. You may not have much time to stop and think about your next move. Things will come up suddenly and you will need to be able to react quickly. The faster you move, the less time you will have to react. For this reason, you may want to consider a side route where things are flowing a bit more slowly.
 ----- 
 You're apt to feel emotionally brave today, Scorpio, so take advantage of this feeling by extending it to the people around you. Try not to get anxious or jump ahead of yourself. Enjoy where you are at this very moment. Don't get stressed about things you feel you need to do. Be happy with yourself regardless of what you end up accomplishing.
 ----- 
 Your biggest dream is in front of you, Sagittarius, yet there's a large object standing in your path. When you peer around one way, the goal is only partly visible. When you peer around the other way, the other side of the dream becomes clear, but you still don't have the complete picture. Instead of working with obscured vision, get rid of the thing that's lying directly in your path.
 ----- 
 Luck and prosperity lie within your grasp now, Capricorn. The only problem is that you might not notice because you're so caught up in some emotional drama that occupies your entire being. Don't concern yourself with issues that don't directly pertain to you. Your time and energy are too precious. Keep your mind focused on your biggest goals.
 ----- 
 You may fall into a bottomless pit today, Aquarius. Be careful about offering so much of yourself that you drain your internal resources. You might think other people will be equally generous about offering themselves to you. Don't assume this. You're better off assuming that you will get nothing in return. Play your cards from this standpoint and you may be a bit more conservative.
 ----- 
 Don't just talk about grand trips around the world 
 ----- 
 Emotional conflict is likely to ensue today if you aren't careful, Aries. People may step on your toes if you give them the opportunity. Make sure you aren't vulnerable to attack. Someone may be ready to confront you, so you must be ready to defend yourself. The best way to combat whatever force tries to shoot you down is to have confidence in yourself even if you don't have everything perfectly planned.
 ----- 
 People may have missed your company lately, Taurus. Make an appearance where you know it will be noticed and appreciated. Look for the good points in others instead of being so judgmental about the bad points. People aren't going to miss you at all if you talk about them behind their backs and only mention the unappealing parts of their personalities.
 ----- 
 Don't act like you have all the answers today, Gemini. This attitude will get you nowhere. Remember that everyone you encounter has something to teach you, so don't disregard that homeless person on the street. The looks you exchange with a stranger may make or break your attitude for the afternoon. Maintain a positive demeanor instead of a sour one and you will be quite successful.
 ----- 
 There's a special power to your words today, Cancer, and an internal confidence that rarely comes around this strongly. You should notice strength in your emotions and personality. Take this opportunity to get one step ahead of the game. You have a special influence that can't be matched by anyone. Don't let others convince you of anything you aren't 100 percent sure of yourself.
 ----- 
 Break open any door that seems to block you today, Leo. It won't take a great deal of effort on your part to accomplish this. The key is to be more flexible in your approach and merge with the group effort instead of trying to fight against it. You will find that when you open yourself to the people around you, there are a significant number who want to break down that same door.
 ----- 
 If you feel like you're running on reserve battery power, Virgo, remember that you always have a reserve tank ready to kick in. Don't disregard this. It might help you to know that there's only a little time left on the clock. You work more efficiently under pressure. Just remain calm and remember that it isn't the end of the world if things don't work out exactly the way you'd like.
 ----- 
 Add a bit of spark to your day, Libra. Get yourself into gear. It might feel like there's a great deal of anticipation in the air, but don't get ahead of yourself. Enjoy the day you've been given, and make sure you use every minute to its fullest potential. Small annoyances may turn into large headaches unless you maintain an honest mind and neutral standpoint.
 ----- 
 Fire up your energy today, Scorpio, and demonstrate your power to conquer. Create a bonfire of activity that gives off a great deal of heat to the people around you. Some might not be able to stand too close now. Don't worry 
 ----- 
 Get out of "gimme" mode, in which every new toy or gadget you see calls out your name, Sagittarius. If you keep thinking that you need these material things in order to be happy, you will never be truly satisfied no matter how much you have. In this same vein, don't think that you need to buy tangible things for others in order to demonstrate your love for them.
 ----- 
 It's important to turn your attention to more spiritual matters now, Capricorn. Consider enrolling in a yoga class that combines meditation with the physical practice. It's vital to link your mind, body, and soul together. The more you can integrate these three parts of your being, the healthier you will feel. A high
 ----- 
 Reach out to those people you know will make you feel better today, Aquarius. There's no reason to sit in your room alone and depressed when you know there are people who would love to hear from you. Don't think that others are too busy to listen to your thoughts and feelings. Your emotions are strong, and your incredibly sensitive mind can offer a great deal of insight.
 ----- 
 Don't get bogged down by past events today, Pisces. It's time to move forward. Leap out of bed as if it were your first day on the planet. Realize how lucky you are to be alive and how much power and influence you have. Use your power wisely, for you will find that it's stronger than usual. Note that relationships with women are apt to be especially rewarding on a day like this.
 ----- 
 Don't feel like you have to rationalize everything, Aries. Accept the fact that there are some things in life that occur without a specific logical explanation. More than likely these are the most interesting events and experiences that add the most spice to your routine existence. Embrace the unknown and encourage more spontaneity and playfulness in your world.
 ----- 
 In order to reach your destination, you may have to take an unusual route today, Taurus. Zigzag your way to the finish line. Don't automatically assume that this is a bad thing. You may find that this is the preferred path. You're likely to experience many side adventures and make some wonderful discoveries. Try to remember how you got there so you can find these spots again.
 ----- 
 Get out of the doldrums and enjoy life, Gemini. The situation is such that if you remain stagnant for a little while, you will soon sink into a spiral of depression and downward thinking. If you stay afloat and focused on your dreams, you will remain active in your pursuit of all your life's goals. You will have the power of the Universe behind you, supporting you all the way.
 ----- 
 This morning is your time to shine, Cancer. You should be in a good mood, with a positive outlook that helps you attack the day's tasks with vitality. Elements of the unexpected may pop up and remind you that things don't always go according to plan. This should be fine, however. You will find that your easygoing approach to life will come in handy when the scheduled route doesn't work.
 ----- 
 You may get a bit frustrated in the morning because of a lack of commitment on the part of others, Leo. You may find it hard to pin down an answer when everything seems to be up in the air. The good news is that things should run much more smoothly by this evening and well into tonight. Note a major boost in emotional self
 ----- 
 The energy you put out today will most definitely fuel the fire, Virgo, so make sure you have an extinguisher within reach. There's a spark of excitement in the air indicating that something new and different is coming around the bend. You may feel anxiety building up. Be patient and you will find that good things naturally come your way.
 ----- 
 You may feel indecisive today, Libra, especially in the morning. Other people's actions may confuse you. Don't worry. Concentrate on your projects and goals. Other people can take care of themselves. Don't feel like you need to make sure everyone is attended to before you start your day. In fact, you may be the one who needs to be cared for by others. Ask for a shoulder to lean on if you need it.
 ----- 
 Emotionally, you should be feeling quite good today, Scorpio. This is important since you may get thrown off balance by a strange, unexpected force. The more stable you are on the inside, the less disruption this foreign energy will cause. Keep in mind that unexpected things usually happen for a reason. There might be a key opportunity waiting for you now.
 ----- 
 Free your mind and consider alternative options, Sagittarius. This is a time to throw away the old to make room for the new. There's a distinct advance in original and forward thinking today. You should make it a point to go to higher levels of thought now. The more idealistic in your approach to people and situations, the better off you will be.
 ----- 
 You might find your energy comes in strong, erratic bursts today, Capricorn. Don't be surprised if you're high as a kite one moment and down in the dumps the next. Even if you're driving everyone crazy with your yo
 ----- 
 You may feel a tendency to do things the same old way today simply because it's what feels most comfortable, Aquarius. Even though the familiar route may be tempting now, it's actually better if you seek a different way to go. Things may feel chaotic, especially in the morning and early afternoon. Still, don't automatically resist things that are new and different.
 ----- 
 An extra log has been thrown on your fire today, Pisces, so don't be surprised if you burn especially hot. Use your internal furnace to make some breakthroughs and bring matters to a higher level. Turn up the intensity on certain issues that require more life. You will bring a great deal of positive energy to just about everything you touch, so use it wisely.
 ----- 
 Information about possible careers and investments might come to your attention today, Aries. You may give a lot of thought to these matters, especially since your thinking is changing along with the times. This is a good day to explore new avenues your life could take over the next six months, and make final decisions, if appropriate. Give this some thought before you act on your plans.
 ----- 
 Taurus, you're likely to be giving a lot of thought to your future. You're probably wondering how best to increase your financial standing. You may be thinking in terms of making some investments in land or property. If you've been considering buying a home, this is a good time to do it. Any paperwork involved now should be finalized swiftly and smoothly.
 ----- 
 If communication has been difficult for you in the past, Gemini, today you may find things a bit different. You may have a deeper understanding of the motives of others, making it easier for you to deal with them. Your intuitive abilities are operating at a high level, so you're likely to form new bonds based on what you sense about others. Celebrate tonight! You need the lift.
 ----- 
 Inside information may come your way today that starts you thinking about improving your financial standing, Cancer.

These will work for you and guide you in the right direction.
 ----- 
 Today your spiritual and career goals may come together, Libra, enabling you to make a living without compromising your ideals. New opportunities may come your way to make new friends with people who share your beliefs and interests. You might reflect nostalgically on the past and yet look to the future with great optimism. Good luck!
 ----- 
 Scorpio, you're looking forward to making a new start. Your intellect is working in harmony with your intuition. Your mind is clearer and more focused than it was, and you're thinking of expanding your horizons and creating new career opportunities for yourself. You're feeling passionate about life, ready to face just about anything. The only challenge right now is to stay grounded in reality.
 ----- 
 The position of the planets could have you doing a lot of soul searching, Sagittarius. You're looking deep within to discern your true goals. You might be pleasantly surprised by what you find. Increased communication and deeper understanding enhance your relationships. Many of your aims are likely to be spiritual in nature. Write them down.
 ----- 
 Today you might take time out from all the recent excitement to take a good look at your working life, Capricorn. Is it satisfying? Is it contributing not only to your own well
 ----- 
 Increased communication between you and those around you, particularly the partner in your life, brings a new understanding between you. Your head and heart seem to be in better accord, so you're feeling especially optimistic right now. This optimism isn't just related to career and financial matters but to private matters, especially your romantic life, too.
 ----- 
 Plans to work at home at least part of the time might be firming up for you, Pisces. Your mind is very much on home and family right now, so you might be thinking in terms of leaving the rat race of the city and creating your own office. Success is highly indicated, so it's well worth going for. If you start planning today, you might have it worked out soon.
 ----- 
 You may get frustrated today when people don't seem to act rationally. To you, Aries, the issues may be perfectly cut and dried. Keep in mind that not everyone sees the world the way you do. There's an element of strong emotion that's likely to play into the picture, an element that you probably failed to take into account. Make note of this as you go through your day.
 ----- 
 Go deeper beneath the surface today, Taurus. You may get along just fine with the way you now handle things. Keep in mind, however, that you aren't likely to progress down your path until you turn up the intensity. If you don't, you may find that someone turns it up for you. Suddenly, volatile emotions could catch you by surprise and you will be floundering for support. Stay ahead of the game.
 ----- 
 You may wonder why it is that you can gain control of so many parts of your life, but nothing seems to go right when it comes to romance? Dismiss the notion that you're unworthy of love. Don't try to portray yourself as someone you're not. Perhaps you're confusing the people around you by projecting an image that's completely different from who you really are.
 ----- 
 Try to stay on the lighter side today, Cancer. This may be easier said than done. You're the bridge that connects an island to the shore. The water is rising and the island is about to be completely submerged. People are scrambling to reach you. Be careful that the situation doesn't become an issue of self
 ----- 
 You may be trying to deal with things in a neat, orderly manner today, Leo. Try not to get too frustrated if things don't work out exactly the way you'd like. Tension may occur when matters of the heart come up for discussion. People may get rather emotional, sending your neat, orderly plan right out the window.
 ----- 
 Just when you thought you had love and romance all worked out in your head, Virgo, something or someone steps in to put your heart in a whirl once again. More than likely, the intensely emotional drama of the day is a passing phase, so try not to get too worked up about it. Situations may seem life or death today, but remember that they aren't.
 ----- 
 Be careful of letting your heart get carried away today, Libra. Extreme emotions are likely, making you very aware of your environment and what other people are thinking about you. You may want to retreat to the forest and seek council with the fairies and trolls. Fantasy is a terrific way to escape the emotional intensity that's likely to be in the air on a day like this.
 ----- 
 Be prepared for an emotional backlash that's likely today if you get too possessive about your romantic partner, Scorpio. Issues about freedom versus commitment could arise whether you're involved in a close relationship or not. Perhaps these feelings are simply internal and you're trying to figure out your position on the matter before you proceed.
 ----- 
 You may feel blocked on all sides today, Sagittarius, with no escape hatch. There's a strong set of forces acting in such a way as to make you feel responsible for some mess that has occurred in your life. Remember that when it comes to partnerships, it takes two to make or break a situation. Don't blame everything on yourself.
 ----- 
 Your emotions could be quite strong today, Capricorn. You may find it difficult to act without having intense feelings come into the picture. Be careful about speaking without first thinking how your words will affect other people. It's important for you to be receptive in order to tune into the activity around you. Be open to others' opinions.
 ----- 
 Other people may find it difficult to deal with today's intensity, Aquarius, but you will be quite adept at fitting into whatever situation comes your way. The waters may get quite rough, especially when it comes to love and romance, but know that the boat you're on is seaworthy. There's also room for others, so let more people on board.
 ----- 
 Issues of the heart may be a bit difficult to deal with now, Pisces. Try not to completely shut off the channels of communication while you work on dealing with these issues. It's vital that you open the channels wider and bring more of your feelings to the surface. Compassionate people will listen to you and help sort out your emotions if you let them.
 ----- 
 You're likely to be very aware of things going on around you today, and you may internalize the opinions of others, Aries. Be careful about opening yourself up so much that you get hurt by someone's offhand, unflattering comment. You will find the most comfort in tangible and stable things. Enjoy the material pleasures in life.
 ----- 
 You may be working on a large project that draws on your creative energy, Taurus. In terms of long
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if someone rubs you the wrong way today, Gemini. It's likely that pressure has been building in other people's minds for quite some time. They might have been afraid to share their feelings before simply because they were too intimidated to say anything that might cross you. The molten lava has finally gotten hot enough and the volcano is about to erupt.
 ----- 
 It's possible that you've relied on your imagination to pull you out of tough situations lately, Cancer. When the real world begins to get you down, you can always turn to your fantasy world. On this day, there's a stubborn blast of realism that might bring you down and keep you there. Unless you've prepared for this grounding force, you could have trouble lifting off again.
 ----- 
 Relax and settle down today, Leo. Take some time to enjoy where you are and the people around you. There's a promise that you need to fulfill, and you should think about how you can honor it now. Do something for others instead of keeping the focus on you and your goals and ambitions. The more you invest in others now, the bigger the payoff you will receive from these actions in the future.
 ----- 
 You may be faced with a difficult choice today in a particular area of your life, Virgo. It's likely the dilemma stems from a desire to follow your creative, imaginative spirit, while another part of you feels held down to things more practical and grounded. See what you can do to combine the two forces and fuse them into one powerful manifestation.
 ----- 
 Today a bubble of confusion clouds your reality, making it difficult to decide what to do next, Libra. Be careful that you don't tie your stomach in knots from the tension created by your mental confusion. Problems with indigestion are likely now because of your worries over what your next step should be. Relax and go with the flow. Things will work out fine.
 ----- 
 Try not to be too swayed by your emotions today, Scorpio. You might get in trouble if you get carried away with a drama that doesn't pertain to you in any way. Your connection to other people's feelings could draw you into a maelstrom. Keep in mind that your imagination is your life raft. Do what you can to distance yourself from the emotional trauma that surrounds you.
 ----- 
 Don't doubt yourself today, Sagittarius. You should be feeling quite strong, although inadequacy could sneak into the picture. This could be because you're having trouble understanding issues that are rather cloudy. Just because things aren't clear doesn't mean they aren't working out in your favor. As long as you remain confident that things will come out fine, they will.
 ----- 
 You're at a creative high point right now, so make sure to nurture this side of your being, Capricorn. It could be that you're in danger of running into an obstacle. Try not to get discouraged. Instead, it may be best for you to reflect on what you've done in the past. Enjoy emotional stability today instead of letting your emotions jump around from one thing to the next.
 ----- 
 You're apt to be in a good mood today, Aquarius. The roller coaster of feelings you've been on is finally coming to a stable platform. Get off the ride and enjoy the comfort of solid ground. Take a walk and treat yourself to something you enjoy 
 ----- 
 It's important to be more sensitive toward other people's feelings today, Pisces. You may feel more vulnerable than usual. You should do what you can to keep from becoming a victim.

 ----- 
 If you've been thinking about going back to school for a degree of some kind, Aries, this is the time to start the process.

A journey you've wanted to take for some time may finally be possible, as could achievements in the fields of writing and speaking. Go for it!
 ----- 
 If you've been thinking of buying a new home, Taurus, this is an excellent time to do it. Surprising developments might clear the way for you. Success through investments of any kind, particularly real estate, looms on the horizon. A young visitor may come to your home today, as well as an important letter or call. In the evening, visit an older friend or relative.
 ----- 
 You may feel a little out of sorts today, Gemini. Perhaps you indulged a bit too much last night. However, some exciting phone calls at midday might perk you up, perhaps good news from a friend or colleague. A change in your financial state is definitely indicated, as is the resulting boost to your self
 ----- 
 Your hard work is finally paying off, Cancer. A phone call bring good news to you. You should be filled with a new sense of optimism, enthusiasm, and hope. Work will be more of a pleasure than a drag, because you have something to look forward to. Changes are definitely in the wind for you, so be prepared for just about anything!
 ----- 
 You're a hard worker, Leo, with a good business head and strong practical sense. However, success in the past few weeks might have you thinking about doing something more innovative to earn your money, possibly something to do with the opportunities surrounding the Internet. Business and personal communication of all kinds should come to you during this auspicious period.
 ----- 
 Some strange phone calls might come your way, perhaps from people you don't know. Investments in real estate, particularly the home, should pay off now. You could also decide to make a new investment in this area. Follow your hunches, Virgo. Don't let your usual logic get in the way! Your mind is especially receptive to messages from other realms now. Make the most of it.
 ----- 
 A long

 ----- 
 Today's celestial energy could find you making plans to travel for pleasure or possibly business. A young friend or relative might accompany you.

This is an excellent period to open up your own business.
 -----

 A friend might approach you with the idea of forming a partnership, and even propose drawing up a tentative agreement. This is definitely something worth looking into, Aquarius, although you should consider all the facts before committing. Success and good fortune are definitely in the works, whether through this partnership or not. Expect an important call from a romantic partner.
 ----- 
 You can look forward to a new sense of purpose and higher morale, Pisces. Ambition, diligence, and a lot of hard work could pay off now. You could soon be raking in the benefits. You're feeling strong, fit, and physically healthy, as if you could seize the world in your two hands. This is a great time to take the next step in your personal relationship.
 ----- 
 Today may be filled with conflict when your legs carry you one way while your heart tugs you in a completely different direction, Aries. Don't get caught in an uncomfortable situation like this. If you move around on automatic pilot all the time, you may end up missing out on the things your heart truly longs for.
 ----- 
 Look for answers to your question today, Taurus. The good news is that the answers are now out there and easily accessible. Seek the truth and you will find it. Make sure you probe more deeply than you might think to do. Instead of just asking for the answer, seek to find the full mechanics behind the problem. In this way, you're much more likely to find ultimate success.
 ----- 
 You may not necessarily approve of the behavior of the people around you, Gemini, but that doesn't mean you need to make their lives miserable. Be more accepting of others. Don't feel like you need to teach people a lesson simply because you don't understand their ways of life. You may be jumping to conclusions without taking the time to understand the situation.
 ----- 
 You have an extra amount of physical vitality to work with now, Cancer, so take advantage of it to give your body a good workout. Eat well and avoid fatty, salty foods. Fuel yourself with carbohydrates, protein, and fresh fruits and vegetables. With high energy, you can get a tremendous amount accomplished. Be aware that your emotional side may be extra sensitive, so be careful of conflict.
 ----- 
 You may keep having the same thoughts over and over in your head, Leo. Each day you may work out a different scenario for the way it comes to an end. You know that you will get to this critical decision at some point in your life, so why not experiment with all the solutions now? Stay calm and turn to others when you get into a bind along the way.
 ----- 
 You may feel like you're on the run in some way or other today, Virgo. It may even seem like someone is chasing you. They're right on your heels and you're doing everything in your power to stay one step ahead. Have confidence in yourself. You will accomplish everything you need to do and still finish in front of the pack. There's a great deal of high energy coming your way.
 ----- 
 Every day is a new start and new chance, Libra. Don't get upset or angry over past events. Don't dwell on things you can't change. Your whole life can turn around in a day, so start every morning with a positive outlook. As you wash your face in the morning, think of it as a renewal. Clean off the debris from yesterday while welcoming the freshness of a new day.
 ----- 
 You're apt to move in and out of sync with people today, Scorpio. At first it may seem quite natural and easy to be in your situation, then the next minute you feel alone and uncomfortable. Understand that it's fine to have two conflicting feelings at the same time. Learn to relate to and embrace both frames of mind. Recognize them as important parts of your personality.
 ----- 
 You may feel as if you're the only one who picks up on the nuances of conversations and actions around you, Sagittarius. Your reaction to things is more than likely quite strong and will have a much greater impact on you now. Use this day to turn things around. It's time for you to create a stir. Be more dynamic and outer directed so you have a chance to release some of that inner energy.
 ----- 
 You may feel emotionally on fire today, Capricorn. One conversation with someone will suddenly spark a discussion of some sort that proves extremely valuable to you in the long run. Expand your mind. You can learn a great deal by opening yourself up to the truth. Making connections with others will help pave the way toward your success.
 ----- 
 Bring more of your feelings into the open today, Aquarius. Don't be so paranoid about what other people think. At times you may feel as if you're in some sort of spy movie with you playing the lead role. The people around you are other players in the game, and you may feel that sometimes they can't be trusted. Maybe they're working for the enemy. It's time to dismiss these thoughts from your mind.
 ----- 
 Have fun today, Pisces, but make sure you're always professional and polite. Appearance and a good
 ----- 
 Even though you feel most comfortable when things are organized and meticulous, Aries, you're going to need to be flexible. Allow room for surprise and adventure. Bask in the adventurous spirit that must be adopted when you walk out the door with no idea where you will end up. People and situations that come around today are likely to be foreign but friendly.
 ----- 
 Finding balance in your world will be no sweat once you get into the groove, Taurus. Waking up is likely to be the most difficult part of the day, but once you conquer that incredible feat, you should be fine. Try taking a cold shower instead of a warm one this morning. This will serve to open up your mind and get your blood pumping when you need it most.
 ----- 
 You may feel like the smallest issue is suddenly a life or death situation, Gemini. Depending on your mood, you may think you're on the brink of complete disaster, but the next minute be soaring high in the clouds. The drama that surrounds you is more a product of your reaction to your environment rather than the environment itself.
 ----- 
 Things may come to you more easily than usual today, Cancer. This is a sign that you're on the right path and doing things correctly. Life shouldn't have to be full of stress and heartache. If something isn't flowing smoothly, you should consider taking a new approach toward it. Keep a smile on your face and be respectful of the people around you.
 ----- 
 Check your messages often, Leo. Someone is trying to contact you and you may keep missing each other by minutes. It's important to connect with this person to take care of some matters. If your objectives are clear, things should work out fine. Two people working toward the same goal make the power of the joint effort extremely potent. Don't underestimate this incredible influence.
 ----- 
 You will get much farther than you think today, even with minimal effort, Virgo. There are plenty of avenues to take now, so even if one is jammed, there's always another that you can reach easily. Soon you will arrive at your destination with time to spare. The trick is to keep moving. Don't get stuck in one place with your engine running.
 ----- 
 Don't get too caught up in the emotional side of life today, Libra. Keep things light and keep them moving. A rolling stone gathers no moss. Unfortunately, you may have quite a bit of that green stuff growing on you now. Get up and get moving. One little bit of effort will send you off and running. Don't hesitate. You're ready to take the plunge.
 ----- 
 Try not to be overwhelmed by the frenzied activity around you, Scorpio. Unexpected variables are popping up everywhere, and your first reaction may be to flip out. This is the opposite reaction that you need to have now. Calm yourself down and take small bites. Don't try to eat the whole eight
 ----- 
 It's time to bring more fire into your life, Sagittarius. Consider calling up an old flame or friend from the past who stirs the passion within you. Inspire your inner yearning for excitement and adventure. Eat spicy foods and adorn yourself in bright colors. Even the smallest actions will help bring more of this dynamic, activating energy to your life.
 ----- 
 This is one of those days in which you may ask for five minutes to complete a certain task and an hour later finally finish whatever you set out to do. Keep in mind that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Things are taking you longer than expected not because you're inefficient but because you're more passionate than usual about what you're doing.
 ----- 
 Don't be afraid of the fire today, Aquarius. Instead, embrace it and incorporate more of it into your life. Certain people may intimidate you at first, but that doesn't mean you should run away from the scene. More than likely this feeling of intimidation is a signal that there's something you need to learn from that person or situation. Stick around and pay attention.
 ----- 
 Tackle things that require high energy today, Pisces. This is your day to make short work of chores, errands, or any sort of physical activity. Patience is the thing that you will lack, if anything, but don't worry, because your strengths lie elsewhere now. Your heart is apt to sing once you get going on a personal project about which you feel passionate.
 ----- 
 An opportunity to do some extra work outside the scope of your regular job could present itself to you. Take it, Aries. Not only could you earn some extra money but you might also open new doors that expand your professional horizons. The only danger is that you might work too hard and tire yourself out. It's OK for a while, but don't make a habit of it. You need to conserve your strength.
 ----- 
 You might be extremely busy now. Invitations to large parties, small gatherings with close friends, and intimate evenings with romantic partners might come up today. Be discriminating in those you accept, Taurus. Concentrate on seeing people who share your interests. This may bring new friends your way, as well as opportunities to expand your horizons. Romance looks great now.
 ----- 
 Unexpected visitors could wake you up to the possibility of new work opportunities, Gemini. This could advance your current job or be work you can do on your own 
 ----- 
 If you aren't romantically involved, an errand, walk, or other foray into your neighborhood might bring an exciting new person into your life. This encounter may or may not lead to something lasting, Cancer, but you will enjoy it anyway! If you're currently involved, a casual outing with your partner could result in intimate conversations that bring the two of you closer.
 ----- 
 Money that you may have been hoping to use to better your living or working condition could suddenly come your way today, Leo. Ideas for how to put it to work in the most efficient, satisfying way could pop into your mind quickly. You will probably want to write them all down, consider your options carefully, and then choose the ones that suit your needs best. Go to it.
 ----- 
 When you run errands today, check the bulletin boards in local businesses. You may have been longing for adventure and dreaming about getting away from it all, Virgo, but today you might find the excitement you crave right in your community. New events, people, and businesses that you will enjoy could be moving in. You might also discover a group that shares one of your interests.
 ----- 
 Information received today excites your imagination and encourages you to start a new artistic or creative project, Libra. Stories, pictures, abstract concepts 
 ----- 
 Adventure is the word for today, Scorpio. A lot of physical and mental energy, as well as enthusiasm, might lead you to aim for goals that others consider too risky or unrealistic. Don't let their opinions stop you. After giving each idea an objective assessment, if you still believe you want to try, start looking into it seriously. People have probably made stranger dreams than this come true!
 ----- 
 New career goals may come your way with the current aspect, Sagittarius, opening up possibilities you may not have considered. This could be very exciting. It might even work toward the fulfillment of childhood dreams that you abandoned long ago. They may involve the arts, modern technology, or both. The only downside is that you might work too hard and get exhausted. Pace yourself.
 ----- 
 Fascinating new information could arrive today from TV or the Internet, opening up new educational opportunities. The possibility of making contact and perhaps visiting new friends in other countries might come to your attention. You will probably find this very exciting, Capricorn, and make plans immediately. This is fine, but be careful to consider all contingencies. Be practical and objective.
 ----- 
 A sudden burst of physical energy and determination could lead to additional income for you, Aquarius. This is probably due to an unexpected opportunity to do some extra work outside the scope of your usual employment. It could also be a long overdue payment for past work. You could also receive acknowledgement of some kind for work well done, further firing your enthusiasm. Go for the gold!
 ----- 
 Friends or a group with which you're affiliated could propose a trip. This might seem like a great adventure, Pisces, so you're likely to go for it. You will probably have a wonderful time. You might make some new friends while you're away, or even fall in love. A little break might fire your enthusiasm for pursuing career or educational opportunities when you return. Go for it!
 ----- 
 You may have to consciously let go of some of your plans, Aries, and simply leave things up to chance. The element of the unexpected can help you out quite a bit, so work with it instead of trying to keep it at bay. The natural flow of events should lead you toward a place of greater freedom. Use your imagination instead of relying completely on mental processes like logic.
 ----- 
 Don't let the positive energy of the day pass you by, Taurus. You're able to grab hold and make greater use of it than most, so don't hesitate to get going early and keep on going until late. Stop contemplating the issues and take action. Take the best aspects of each side of the issue instead of feeling like you're restricted to one side or the other.
 ----- 
 You may be tempted to make up your own rules, Gemini, because you really aren't happy with the ones before you. Be careful of doing so without first understanding the full implications for you and the people around you. By all means, if you feel like certain things just aren't right, take steps to change them. There's no reason that you have to stay within traditional constraints.
 ----- 
 Your actions may be erratic and spontaneous today, Cancer, but they will also most certainly be powerful. You may be driven by a sharp intellectual mind. Perhaps there's someone near you who has great cunning. You may be feeling brainier than usual. Genius ideas are apt to surround you and your actions as long as you keep an open mind about how and when they manifest.
 ----- 
 Take some time to break out of your normal routine and see what's going on in the world around you, Leo. You could be so focused and so driven toward a specific goal that you fail to take into account the rest of the world. You may not even be aware that these outside energies have a huge effect on what you're doing in your own little compartment.
 ----- 
 Don't feel like you're obligated to jump through other people's hoops, Virgo. Just because someone wants you to do something doesn't mean you have to oblige. Bend over backward for yourself and not for the entertainment of others. Freedom is an operative word for you, so make sure you exercise this right in every aspect of your life. No one else is going to do it for you.
 ----- 
 You may be acting unconsciously, Libra. Suddenly you're halfway through a task and wondering what you really hoped to accomplish by starting it in the first place. Be more conscious of your energy and how you use it. Make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot by wasting your precious resources on things that don't really matter in the long run.
 ----- 
 You can rely on your good luck to pull you out of difficult situations today, Scorpio. This is one day when you can launch yourself headfirst without worrying too much about the outcome. There's a great deal of positive energy on your side that you may not even be able to see right now. Trust that whatever you undertake will work out fortuitously for you in the long run.
 ----- 
 You may have your guard up as you fend off people and situations that have caught you unprepared, Sagittarius. Be careful about putting up such big walls that you can't see over them. The danger of building a fortress that doesn't allow others to come in is that it makes it more difficult for you to look out. Leave one wall shorter so you don't cut yourself off from the outside world.
 ----- 
 An element of the mystical and fanciful will play a significant part in your world today, Capricorn. This energy is likely to come to you unexpectedly, and your first reaction might be to shy away from it. Believe in the power of thought and intention. Pursue whatever you wish to achieve in your world. Putting a great deal of willpower behind your actions will make you more likely to succeed.
 ----- 
 You may sense that the actions around you are fueled by selfish motives. You may be the only one who really sees what's going on, Aquarius. You feel like an observer on a mountain looking down with disdain on the people below. You understand the politics of the situation, yet from your high vista you feel powerless to implement effective change. Collect data now and act later.
 ----- 
 Take action that will help you find greater freedom in your life, Pisces. In an attempt to please the people around you, you may be giving up too much of yourself. Before you know it, you may be in shackles connected to people, situations, and commitments that you can't seem to extricate yourself from. Use today to free yourself from these chains.
 ----- 
 If you haven't gotten the love you want lately, Aries, perhaps it's because you haven't asked for it. If you're involved with someone and feel unfulfilled, consider having a heart
 ----- 
 Feel free to upset the equilibrium in order to have your needs met, especially in the bedroom, Taurus. In an effort to maintain the peace and keep everything on an even keel, you've neglected your desires for the sake of pleasing someone else. Making compromises for others can be noble, but it may never get you exactly what you want. This is a time to be more aggressive in your pursuit of love.
 ----- 
 Nothing is too hot for you to handle, but why do you insist on burning your hand when you don't have to, Gemini? Are you trying to prove to someone that you can take the heat without being affected by it? You can get burned just as easily as anyone else even if you deny it. Do things for you and not to prove something to other people, especially when it comes to matters of love and romance.
 ----- 
 Your physical energy is strong. Your desire for passion and love is intense, Cancer. Combine these two forces for a passionate night of love and romance. No one will be able to resist your power. The key now is to make sure that you aren't giving yourself away to someone who's unworthy of your love. Match yourself with a person who appreciates you for the amazing person you re.
 ----- 
 Matters of the heart may not be going smoothly, Leo. Perhaps someone's approach has been too aggressive. Maybe you've been too pushy about what you want. Tension builds up and creates disharmony instead of love. Perhaps you need to examine the dynamics of the relationship. Tough times may indicate that the honeymoon is over. If you're single, it's probably for the best right now.
 ----- 
 When it comes to love and romance, you're probably on fire, Virgo. You have an incredible passion for love now, making you one of the most desirable catches around. Partner with someone who shares your thirst for adventure, spontaneity, and the bizarre. You need someone who can keep up with your erratic and powerful energy. If the person you're with doesn't fill the bill, look elsewhere.
 ----- 
 If things aren't going smoothly in a romantic relationship, be careful about blaming yourself, Libra. A partnership means that two people work together equally. If this isn't the case, let your partner know how you feel. While the passion may run high between you, the real glue that will hold you together is sincerity, sensitivity, and mutual understanding.
 ----- 
 Your sex drive is apt to be strong today. This could be the only thing on your mind, Scorpio. Every person you see may stir feelings in you, even though you may already be committed to someone. If you aren't in a relationship, this is the time to make a move. Your desire for love is strong, so you should take action.
 ----- 
 Bring more fire and passion to your love life, Sagittarius. Spark things up by being more adventurous. The bolder you are, the more response you will get. Even though you may like to plan ahead and take things slowly, your romantic life is one area where you might do better taking the opposite approach. Have confidence and be spontaneous in all matters having to do with love.
 ----- 
 Recent conflicts may stir up some anger in you, Capricorn. This is a powerful force, and you could be tempted to get into a big fight. Put the weapons away and bring out the olive branch. Take that energy that has built up and use it to fuel your romantic affairs instead of warlike ventures. Defuse the situation by sharing passionate nights with the one you love.
 ----- 
 You may not be having the best of luck when it comes to matters of the heart, Aquarius, and you may feel you need to take some sort of action. Be careful of acting just for the sake of creating movement. Perhaps the best policy for you now is to relax where you are and wait for the perfect love to come to you. Your battery will be well charged when the time comes to use it.
 ----- 
 Love and romance are in the air tonight, so feel free to let loose, Pisces. Instead of being a passive, gentle, soft kind of love, the emotion you feel may be more forceful, passionate, and aggressive. Roll with this feeling as you seduce the object of your desire. Take charge in the bedroom as you lure your mate with your fantastic love of life and desire to have a good time.
 ----- 
 Things may be coming to a dramatic climax for you, Aries. It may seem like everything is working against you. Take note that this is an excellent time to find balance and gain a much greater perspective on the issues in your life. If you're trying to figure out where your heart and brain are hiding, you should look on the opposite side of the world. They're over there discussing things together.
 ----- 
 Dig out the paints and get your creative energy flowing, Taurus. Keep in mind that you might not have the discipline or commitment to finish any project you start today, but you most certainly won't lack creative energy. Merge your mental and emotional processes and have them work together on a blank canvas. Bring beauty to the world by letting yourself shine for others to see.
 ----- 
 Today is a terrific day for you, Gemini. You finally seem to have a grasp on your thought processes and inner emotions. You will feel extra sensitive and loving, and people will be drawn to you because of it. You're able to look at your feelings in a rational, levelheaded manner instead being at the mercy of your wildly fluctuating emotions.
 ----- 
 There may be some rough spots today that could be difficult to iron out, Cancer. No matter what you do, you land just a bit short of the mark. Perhaps your indecisiveness is making it too difficult for you to be effective. Your easygoing way of naturally going with the flow is making it easier for other people to manipulate you into doing what they want. Take control of the situation.
 ----- 
 Nurture your artistic, romantic side today, Leo. Your feet may be a little cold, but that's what you get for splashing around in the rain. Don't worry about it. Your heart and mind are finally on the same page and it's much easier to say exactly how you feel. Take off the wet socks and put on a dry pair. Take to the streets and meet up with a fun troupe of merriment tonight.
 ----- 
 Today may be one of those days when you feel all dressed up with nowhere to go. Don't worry about the details, Virgo. Follow your heart to a fantasyland and join the outlandish and bizarre. The answer you seek is around the corner. You may sense that it's close but yet far. This is completely understandable. Take control of your destiny and work toward the goals that you've set.
 ----- 
 This is a fantastic day, Libra. Elements of your life seem to be falling into place. You're in a period when you're beginning new cycles of love and mental activity. These beginning points are highlighted. You should think about how you want to be remembered in the future. Your heart and mind are working harmoniously, so take advantage of this to lay down some plans.
 ----- 
 This is one of those days in which you can't figure out what to order for dinner. You're the official owner of the cloudy head today, Scorpio. You're waiting at the deli counter trying to figure out what you want and when it's your turn to order, you've already forgotten. Your emotions may be so tied up in your brain that you can't think straight. Try to mellow out and watch a movie.
 ----- 
 Go to an art museum, Sagittarius. Your mind and heart are working in conjunction with each other, and you're apt to be especially receptive to elements of our world that fuse these two together. Make an evening out of the event, and be sure to take a good friend or romantic partner. Have a good meal, and don't forget dessert. Appreciate the world for all its natural wonder.
 ----- 
 It might seem like your brain and heart are working against you today, Capricorn. You might sense that they've teamed up to keep your head in a swirling maelstrom of confusion that you can't seem to pull out of. Look beyond the mundane confusion of this day. Connect with your sensitive, receptive side, sit back, and let someone else do the thinking.
 ----- 
 Your moods are always fluctuating. Today looks like you're on an up note, Aquarius, so enjoy the caring, sensitive mood of the day. You should find that you can clearly express your emotions on a more intellectual level. At the same time, you're also able to put more feeling and sensitivity in your otherwise dry intellect. Realize that we are all one.
 ----- 
 You might find it difficult to connect with others today, Pisces. Your brain may seem like it's in some other dimension. Appreciate the power of circular movement in your life. Seek things that are fast paced and a bit bizarre. Go to a roller derby. A simple thing like a coin rolling down the sidewalk may allow you to connect with another way of thinking about your life.
 ----- 
 Reading could take up a lot of your time today, Aries. Books on psychology or the occult sciences might seem interesting, particularly as your intuition is operating on a higher level than usual. You might not want to talk about what's coming up for you, but that's OK. You will need to make sense of it first before you can share it with clarity.
 ----- 
 Your mind is likely to be on your finances today, Taurus, and you may be searching for previously unknown ways to advance yourself. Colleagues or friends could help steer you in the right direction. When it comes to jotting down possibilities, trust your intuition, as it's operating at a very high level. List your possibilities and then let it stew for a few days before going over them again.
 ----- 
 Increased communication with a close friend or lover, more on a subtle than verbal level, could bring you closer and enrich your relationship. Quiet time spend together today could generate a new sense of closeness. Images and ideas that come from deep within you can contribute to your creative self
 ----- 
 Today you might crave solitude, Cancer, perhaps for meditation or to contemplate your current situation. You may feel you're at a crossroads and need to decide which way to go. This could involve the next step in your material progress or self
 ----- 
 You might spend a lot of time in conversation with friends who share your interests. Their insights could lead to new insights on your part, Leo, and vice versa. This process could bring all of you closer together. Good news could come through the mail, email, or phone regarding goals you've been trying to reach. You're also likely to send out a lot of communications yourself.
 ----- 
 Paperwork involving finances, Virgo, perhaps personal, perhaps involving your employer's funds, or both, is likely to need some intense attention during the day. This doesn't necessarily imply anything negative. In fact, just the opposite. It does mean that some careful planning or budgeting is going to be required in order to make the most of your current situation.
 ----- 
 Today you may want to spend your free time alone, contemplating various ideas, Libra. Spiritual or metaphysical philosophies from ancient cultures or foreign lands might be more appealing than usual. Reading about them at this time could approach obsession, but this is OK. Whatever you learn today is likely to contribute greatly to your personal growth and perhaps self
 ----- 
 Today, Scorpio, your mind may turn toward deep subjects. You could explore the sciences, psychology, the occult, or metaphysics. You will probably discover some new facts or ideas that could keep your mind occupied for hours. Needless to say, you will spend much of your time alone exploring these themes. You might also want to write down your insights and revelations to study later.
 ----- 
 A sudden upsurge in your intuition could have you feeling more in tune to the thoughts, feelings, and desires of others, Sagittarius. Your communication is going to be clear and open as a result. You're likely to grow closer to everyone dear to you, especially your romantic partner. Don't expect everything you pick up to be positive. Others have their issues. Let them know you understand.
 ----- 
 Your mind is strong and focused today, Capricorn. As a result, you're probably feeling especially physically robust. Sudden insights could earn you some satisfying acknowledgement, not to mention the respect of someone important to you. Your intuition level is high and apt to serve you well now, particularly where work and health are concerned. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Expect to spend much of your day alone, Aquarius. Information obtained from books or videos, perhaps involving history, philosophy, or religion, might inspire you to look deeper into a subject and turn it to your own advantage. You might decide to take a trip or return to college. There's also the chance that you could be inspired to write or otherwise express your ideas and feelings. Go to it!
 ----- 
 Some strange dreams could stimulate your imagination and start you on new avenues of exploration. You might at some point play detective. What you seek is likely to be within your psyche. Don't be surprised if you learn new things about yourself that you hadn't been aware of before. You could also find your psychic faculties increasing.
 ----- 
 You might be feeling somewhat under the weather, Aries. You're probably stressed and in need of rest. Work concerns could also be confusing. You might have a lot of tasks to do and not be certain where to start. Maybe you shouldn't start today at all. Perhaps you need to take the day off to rest and then tackle it tomorrow when you're feeling like yourself again. Think about it!
 ----- 
 Recent successes have you feeling especially pressured to continue on your path, Taurus. You may have to make some choices regarding your activities outside of career and family. You may have a lot of interests that all mean a lot to you, which makes it difficult to make choices. Don't try to consider it today. Your mind is a bit befuddled. Wait a few days and then consider your options.
 ----- 
 A letter or call from a relative could result in the prospect of an unexpected houseguest. You might be in a quandary as to what to do about it, Gemini. Your schedule could be crammed with other responsibilities. Don't feel pressured into making any decisions today. Think about it for a day or so and list your options. Consider them all and then make your decision.
 ----- 
 Travel plans might have you confused, Cancer. You may have a number of possibilities in mind, and all seem equally attractive. It probably isn't feasible to go for them all. You may also face decisions regarding your education. You're probably going to have to make a choice, but today isn't the day to do it. Confusion is likely to reign. Wait a few days and then consider your options carefully.
 ----- 
 New earning or investment possibilities could have you in a quandary over which one is the best for you, Leo. There are a number of solutions 
 ----- 
 Your life may seem to be at a crossroads, Virgo. A number of different possibilities could be opening up to you. The only thing that seems certain now is that changes are on the horizon. You will be facing some choices, but today isn't the day to consider them. Confusion reigns supreme. Be like Scarlet O'Hara and think about it tomorrow! You will be more focused and less doubtful by then.
 ----- 
 Others' attitudes toward you may seem to be changing. You may not be sure what this means. The fact is, Libra, you're changing, and some of your friends may like what you're becoming and others may feel less comfortable. You can't stop what's happening. It's going to be a very positive process in the long run. It just may be difficult now. Bear with your friends and yourself.
 ----- 
 A number of different and unexpected professional and personal possibilities might have you a bit confused about which way you want to go, Scorpio. You may face a choice of some kind, but right now you aren't really sure about the direction you want to take. Don't rush it. It isn't necessary to do it all today. Wait a few days, consider your options and then make your decision.
 ----- 
 Today you might face a choice, Sagittarius. You might be thinking in terms of relocating to advance your career, but you could be confused about your options. You might be grappling with several options. Input from family members isn't likely to help at this time. Wait a few days and then think seriously about what you want to do.
 ----- 
 An intellectual problem may prove confusing, Capricorn, and reading and research reveal contradictory information. You might also hear some gossip that doesn't seem quite right. This isn't the day to believe everything you read or hear or to try to make sense of anything that has you befuddled. You will be in a better space later. Put it aside for a few days and then tackle it.
 ----- 
 Confusion about money might be on your mind today, Aquarius. This doesn't necessarily mean that your finances are in chaos. Chances are that you face unfamiliar options concerning your financial future, and so you may be in no position to make any kind of decision. Don't feel that you have to do it today. It would be best if you waited a few days until you're a bit more focused to consider your options.
 ----- 
 A relationship that you may have recently formed might have you in a dither today, Pisces. This could be romantic or some other sort of acquaintance. You might not be sure about which way you want this involvement to develop. This isn't the day to think much about it, as things probably won't become clear today. Wait a few days, get to know the person a little better, and then consider your options.
 ----- 
 A relationship with a close partner may get a bit confused, Aries. You could react quickly to a situation without really thinking before speaking. There may be some confusion in your mind about whether to stay silent or take a more aggressive route and blurt out everything you feel. It's important that you find an equal balance of both.
 ----- 
 You may run into a great deal of opposition from just about every quarter, Taurus. The most frustrating part about this is that even the people you turn to for help will transform the situation into an even bigger mess. Instead of finding relief, you may find more complications and misunderstandings. Perhaps you need to take the situation into your own hands and deal with it yourself.
 ----- 
 You're becoming much more perceptive, Gemini. At the same time, your psyche and unconscious knowing are also more acute. You may find that you know more about the way someone feels than that person does. More than likely, this sort of perspective is causing you to want to take aggressive action in order to shake people up and help them open their own eyes to the situation at hand.
 ----- 
 You're likely to act with great immediacy, Cancer. You will instantly know what to do in a situation, especially a crisis. You're likely to be thinking at top speed and moving with efficiency and courage. You should feel strong knowing that there's a terrific support system surrounding you in case things go awry. Go out on a limb and take a chance that you might not have considered before.
 ----- 
 If someone tries to criticize you, Leo, don't be afraid to defend yourself. Other people aren't going to be afraid to speak their minds, and you shouldn't either. You may feel like someone is prodding you with a stick. They probably just want to get some sort of reaction out of you. Be honest about how you feel and explain your statements instead of just being curt.
 ----- 
 Be a friend to someone new and lend a hand to a greater cause than just your own advancement, Virgo. Ally with people by offering your support instead of asking for it. Give more of yourself and you will find that in the long run you will receive a great deal more than you ever would have asked for. Be generous to the people around you and form collective goals that will benefit everyone.
 ----- 
 The gas is on, Libra. One spark can cause an explosive fireball. There's a tremendous amount of potential energy to the day just waiting to be unleashed. Know what you're getting into before you light that match. The effects of your actions will ripple for some time. That said, go ahead and set the situation on fire. Perhaps there's an issue brewing that can no longer be ignored.
 ----- 
 This is truly a day of new beginnings, Scorpio. You can start a fresh cycle of emotions and understanding that can help you develop the quality and depth of your relationships. Note that all levels of your relationships will be affected in some way. Take time to consider the fact that you're at the starting line. Focus and align yourself with your goals and the people who can help you meet them.
 ----- 
 Stop dwelling on old projects and routines based on situations that have long since expired, Sagittarius. Note the changes that have occurred around you and adjust your plans. This is a good time to honestly examine your situation. Being aggressive in your approach toward improvement and change means letting go of what no longer serves you. Move forward with courage instead of hesitation.
 ----- 
 You're apt to feel stronger within, helping you to connect the inner and outer sides of your personality, Capricorn. You may feel like you have all your troops united on a common front and are making tremendous progress toward reaching your goals. Don't stop. Your momentum is strong. Things you set in motion now will have a tremendous effect that will continue to increase over time.
 ----- 
 There's an explosive quality about the day. You may walk along, minding your own business, when someone accidentally bumps into you. Your first reaction may be to push that person back. Carelessness on the part of others may cause you to get worked up into fits of rage. Do your best to keep these tendencies under control, especially when driving.
 ----- 
 You have a tremendous amount of drive and enthusiasm to help you move forward in your projects, Pisces. Be careful that you don't act hastily or impulsively. Be careful of starting out on a new path without having a good idea about where it's going. Rash decisions may lead to dangerous situations, so know what direction to go in before you start the car. Be safe.
 ----- 
 There's an emotional intensity inside you today that's squirming to find a way out, Aries. Sudden outbursts are likely, so take care to hold your temper in check. Surround yourself with good friends who can support your erratic feelings. Don't be clingy. Seek friends who are thoughtful listeners, not permanent crutches. They may be feeling the same strong tension and don't need an extra burden.
 ----- 
 Today may have some crazy emotional ups and downs, Taurus. There seems to be an intense cloud seeping into every part of your day. Don't try to fool people. They will see right through you. Bursts of positive energy will pop out of nowhere to remind you of your more important purpose. Try not to get so bogged down in the heaviness of the day that you fail to spot opportunities that arise.
 ----- 
 This day will be filled with many exciting surprises for you, Gemini. Approach it with gratitude and you will be amazed at the number of things that just naturally seem to flow your way. Your generous heart will be rewarded in unexpected ways. Old friends are likely to show up. Open yourself up to conversations. Act spontaneously and with a great deal of passion.
 ----- 
 There's a larger trend operating in your life, Cancer. It's asking you to break the rules and enter a new realm 
 ----- 
 Pour yourself a comforting cup of tea today, Leo. Take a hot shower or a long bath. In short, pamper yourself. You may be picking up on the extra tension of the people around you. Be conscious of this and make a mental note to strip away the garbage that others dump on you. You're a sensitive individual. Pat yourself on the back and look out for sudden moves from others.
 ----- 
 It may be that people are a bit upset by some of your recent actions or words, Virgo. The offhand remark you made a couple weeks ago is catching up to you. What you may consider friendly, lighthearted sparring may actual do a bit of damage to someone's sensitive emotions, especially today. Think before you speak. Others might not have as tough a skin as they seem to have.
 ----- 
 This is an exciting day for you, Libra. You can accomplish quite a bit. Your intuition is especially acute and your sensitivity is strong. Computers might irritate you today. It's possible to get all worked up if your laptop crashes. Save your work often. Keep in mind that it's just a machine. Don't let it get the better of you.
 ----- 
 You might be a bit jittery, even without caffeine, Scorpio. Sudden actions may cause people to freak out, since people will be on edge in general today anyway. Save the surprises for another time. If you need to tell your boss that you're going on vacation for a little while, now isn't the time. There's a rough edge to the astral energy. Relax to soothe your soul.
 ----- 
 Things may be coming at you from all angles today, Sagittarius. Sooner or later you will be forced to take action. It may seem like the walls of the room are slowly caving in. The pressure is building and the air is getting stagnant. Go out for a run. Exercise will help you release some of that pressure you feel.
 ----- 
 You may be excited about an idea today, Capricorn, but unfortunately no one else may be. You spring up with enthusiasm only to smack into a brick wall. One side of you may be communicative and witty while the other is confused. The two sides aren't really connecting well, so perhaps you should just lay low. Hold on to your ideas, and save their presentation for a later day.
 ----- 
 Much of today will be a continuation of yesterday, but with perhaps a bit more intensity for you, Aquarius. There's an added buzz in the air, like static on a radio. This background noise may not provide the best environment to work in, but you should be able to navigate with no problem. Tune out the chatter and move on.
 ----- 
 Today is one of those days when you might feel like four people have a hold of each of your limbs, Pisces. The people are tugging and you're getting stretched in every direction. Someone wants you to go there, someone wants you to come here. Take some time out for yourself and clearly state your needs to others. Make it known what the best situation for you would be.
 ----- 
 An increase in your financial status could lead to changes in your household. You might choose to redecorate or purchase new furniture or move to a better place. A household member might move out. Although it seems illogical, Aries, the changes in your surroundings reflect the transformations taking place within you. Don't let fear or inertia hold you back. Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 Inner transformation is likely to make a big difference in your communications right now, Taurus. Your relationships could improve because you're more open and honest without being too blunt. You seem to have a greater understanding of the needs and desires of those closest to you. Unfortunately, this process could also involve leaving some old friends behind. Don't fight it.
 ----- 
 Increased enthusiasm for your favorite project may take you in a new direction, Gemini. You could even decide to change careers in order to devote yourself more fully to doing what you've discovered you love the most. Your physical, emotional, and spiritual health should be very good right now. Your quality of life is likely to be improving. Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 If you're in a committed relationship, expect to feel a new sense of mutual purpose and make some new friends. If you aren't involved, Cancer, love could come into your life today. You may just think it's about time, but changes in you are attracting interesting people. Children who come into your life now might prove to be natural gurus who help you in your spiritual quest.
 ----- 
 Positive emotions like love, enthusiasm, or optimism that have been repressed for years could surface today, bringing a new sense of joy and anticipation for the future, Leo. This could involve activities that you enjoyed as a child. Don't feel silly if you want to ride a merry
 ----- 
 Group activities like rallies or festivals could take place in your neighborhood today. You may attend, Virgo, and you could learn some new concepts that give impetus to your spiritual growth. You may run into some old friends you haven't seen for a while. Talking with others could start your mind in a new direction. Take a walk before you go to bed tonight or you might not be able to sleep.
 ----- 
 The development of a talent that you've neglected could have surprising results, Libra. You could find that it's just what you need in order to expand your horizons and catapult you into whatever situation you want to be in. This could lead to an increased income. You're changing inside, and these changes are mostly positive. They may also be reflected in your outer life.
 ----- 
 A period of great inner transformation and powerful upheaval in your outer life is coming upon you now, Scorpio. A part of you wants to welcome it and charge ahead, while another part holds back, possibly out of fear or lack of self
 ----- 
 Your intuition should be growing by leaps and bounds. Today you may get psychic messages from everywhere, both personal and universal. This can be a bit overwhelming, Sagittarius, particularly if you aren't used to it, but don't fight it. It's a symptom of your inner growth. It should be a very positive development in the long run. It can help turn your dearest dreams into reality.
 ----- 
 A number of new and exciting relationships could appear in your life now, some of them showing promise of becoming close. Old ones seem to be fading. This can make you a little sad, Capricorn, but it's a process that you can't stop. As you change inside, so your relationships change. You might attract friends who share new interests. Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 Rewards from hard work and dedication could finally be in the offing, Aquarius. You experience the warm feeling that comes from deep satisfaction and knowing that you deserve everything wonderful that's happening. You will want to bask in your happiness with your loved ones. Plan a celebration and share your good fortune with the people who have supported you.
 ----- 
 Educational or spiritual growth on your part is likely to attract new friends who could become close companions. There could even be a new romantic partner in the bunch. This comes from the expansion of your mind, Pisces. The new people should share your interests and turn into companions on your quest for enlightenment. Accept their friendship and move ahead. Don't look back 
 ----- 
 An unexpected visit from a gloomy or depressed person might have you feeling a little disconcerted, Aries. Don't try to be too cheerful. It's more important to be a good listener. You might also be a bit on edge today and jump at sudden noises. Take care not to read too much into it. This oversensitivity is only temporary and should pass within a few days.
 ----- 
 Unexpected contact with a lover, relative, young person, or close friend could leave you feeling exhilarated and optimistic about the future. More frequent communication with this person will probably result, and it could mean a positive outcome in your life. You might write a lot of letters or make a lot of calls, perhaps tying up loose ends from the past. Face the future, Taurus. Change is coming.
 ----- 
 Events beyond your control may necessitate repairs to your home or yard, and some may seem overwhelming, Gemini. Don't panic! Put your good sense to work and shop around for the best possible deal, or find a way to do it yourself. You might discover that whatever needs repair could be in better shape afterward. This could produce desirable results in the long run.
 ----- 
 A rather unsettling communication could cause you to dwell on the negative side of whatever you learn, Cancer. Don't fall into this trap. The positive side will become more apparent as the day wanes. You might decide to purchase some new equipment to enhance your communications, perhaps a phone or new computer. Try not to spend too much of your day learning how to use it!
 ----- 
 Unsettling developments regarding money could cause some upset, Leo, but they'll be resolved by day's end. You could lose and find your wallet or bank errors could prove to be its fault and not yours. Someone you thought you knew well could show a darker side you haven't seen before and cause you to reevaluate your involvement with that person. This is a great day to resolve inner issues.
 ----- 
 A fortunate change of circumstances in a friend's life could have a positive impact on your life, Virgo. This situation could involve a lot of adjustment, not to mention hard work. At times you may feel overwhelmed and somewhat intimidated by these developments. It's best to ignore these feelings and push on. Don't expect immediate results. They will come. Hang onto your optimism.
 ----- 
 Today represents the start of a period of endings and new beginnings in your career, Libra. You might be leaving an old job for a new one or advancing to a new position with your current employer. New technology may play a part in this transition or new knowledge that you've recently acquired, or both. A possible drawback is that stress may affect your energy. Pace yourself.
 ----- 
 Your sense of adventure is in full swing today, Scorpio. New and unusual pastimes, travel to exotic places, meeting new and interesting people 
 ----- 
 Sudden personal or professional change could come your way, Sagittarius. Perhaps you will get a new job opportunity. Perhaps you will meet someone who will change your life. This is a day to savor good luck and new beginnings. They show promise of lasting for a while. Relax and enjoy your optimism and enthusiasm for the future.
 ----- 
 You might contemplate a change of residence, or at least a change in household. Someone could move out or move in. Travel might be on your mind. You could decide to plan a trip by air either out of state or out of the country. These changes imply expansion not only in your worldly life but also within. Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 Better communication should pave the way for personal and professional advancement, Aquarius. You might come to a new understanding with colleagues or you could get some state
 ----- 
 You may feel a little upset and somewhat depressed by a temporary separation from a loved one. As a result, you might throw your energy into creative projects. The results could show a power and intensity that you don't usually expect. Children and young people could benefit from your advice and guidance now, Pisces, so don't be afraid to give it. Just express yourself clearly.
 ----- 
 If you wake up this morning and feel glued to the bed, perhaps that's where you should spend the day, Aries. You've been working hard and long these past few weeks. It only makes sense that your body would rebel eventually. This is a day for rest and relaxation. The office will survive without you. Call in sick and then turn off the phone. You're likely to sleep better than you have in a long time.
 ----- 
 Pay attention today, Taurus. There may be some unethical behavior occurring at work, and it could trigger some long
 ----- 
 Check and double
 ----- 
 Don't take your bank or portfolio statement at face value today, Cancer. Financial errors are likely. Someone may want you to see things from his or her viewpoint, which may not be based on fact. Check and double
 ----- 
 You won't feel particularly social today, Leo. You'd be happiest at home with a good book, a good meal, and no contact with the outside world. Alas, such solitude isn't always possible. You may have to balance your need for isolation with obligations to colleagues. Part of your grumpiness might be due to a physical imbalance. Make it an early night and you will wake tomorrow with a new attitude.
 ----- 
 All isn't quiet at home today, Virgo. There's tension in the air. You can't shake the feeling that someone is lying. You're a peacemaker by nature, so your inclination is to suppress your suspicions. In this instance, your instincts are right. The person withholding information is doing it for your own good and will come to you once the situation has been resolved. You can all laugh about it then.
 ----- 
 It's strange how past incidents can still cause such pain in the present. Today you may feel overwhelmed by memories of a particularly traumatic incident. No one is more surprised than you by your reaction. You felt sure you'd addressed this issue and put it behind you. Apparently there's still work to be done, Libra.
 ----- 
 It's apparent that something underhanded and unethical is occurring at your job today, Scorpio. Co
 ----- 
 Don't trust anyone today, not even people you consider friends, Sagittarius. There are indications of deception all around, especially at work. Someone may be keeping something from you or even manipulating information to his or her own advantage. Be sure to check the facts of any situation. Don't take anyone's word for anything. This is a good day to take your own advice rather than someone else's.
 ----- 
 Don't trust anything related to money or contracts today, Capricorn. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of contract, whether it's starting an investment program, negotiating a salary, or changing banks. There's a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding in the air. You may think you understand what you're signing, but you may not. Save legal and financial matters for another day.
 ----- 
 This isn't the day for contracts or legal work of any kind, Aquarius. You may think you understand everything about a document, but it's likely you don't. The atmosphere is ripe for misinformation and misunderstanding. You will be well served today if you keep to yourself and do your work carefully and systematically. The legal documents can wait for another day.
 ----- 
 Trust your instincts regarding anyone you meet today, Pisces. There are unethical people around, and one of them may enter your circle. Entering into legal contracts or business or personal partnerships of any kind is absolutely out of the question. Don't even go to renew your driver's license, as you're likely to fail the eye exam! Stay home and save contracts and bureaucracy for another day.
 ----- 
 You're gifted in ways you don't even know about, Aries. Today you may uncover that gift unexpectedly. Perhaps you doodle a silly drawing in the margin of a note to a friend. Studying it reveals an idea that would be good for a children's book illustration. Perhaps there are other things you could do with your life. Research other possibilities online.
 ----- 
 A trip to a museum or gallery could bring you some interesting insights, Taurus. Maybe you will ignore the realistic paintings and photographs that used to interest you and admire the abstract works instead. They definitely capture your interest, and by the end of the day you may consider taking an art class to learn more about them.
 ----- 
 Home and technology figure prominently today, Gemini. Perhaps you've just bought the latest gadget and want to spend the day figuring out how it works. You're in your element! A phone call from a distant friend could interrupt your project. You may speak for a long time, but you won't mind the delay at all. It's wonderful to talk to old friends.
 ----- 
 If you've wanted to get involved in some type of volunteer organization, today may be when you sign up to support a worthy cause. Whether it's an envirnomental charity or a volunteer opportunity, you realize that working to better the planet is an important element that has been missing in your life. Life glows all that much brighter with your new altruistic outlook, Cancer.
 ----- 
 Your career is about to take a turn for the better, Leo. New professional possibilities may come your way today. Be receptive to any invitations or offers. Your advancement may not come in the most traditional way, so you need to pay close attention. Don't overlook something that seems beyond your capabilities. Your reach should always exceed your grasp. Stretch!
 ----- 
 Anticipation is often as good as, if not better than, the actual event, Virgo. This is what you experience today as you and your partner plan an exciting getaway. It's a busy day, booking hotels and airline tickets, but it's fun, too. You and your mate are giddy with the excitement of it all. This is just what your relationship needs.
 ----- 
 Past issues may rear their ugly heads today, Libra. No, it isn't pretty. In fact, it's frustrating to have to deal with this problem again. You will be well served to spend time meditating. You need to address these issues once and for all or they will continue to haunt you. You're fortunate to have such close friends who will support you through this difficult process.
 ----- 
 Romance is in the air, Scorpio, filtering your vision with a rosy light. You're in love with the world today, and you're most especially in love with your partner. If you don't already have a partner, you may meet him or her today. Since you never know when or where, make sure to look your best throughout the day.
 ----- 
 All sorts of wonderful changes are in the air at home and at work, Sagittarius. On the personal front, someone new is likely to enter your life and change it for the better. At work, perhaps a proposal you submitted has been accepted or you landed a deal you've been working on for some time. Enjoy this auspicious celestial energy!
 ----- 
 There's a big world out there beckoning to you, Capricorn. Why not plan an adventure to a faraway land? You've been working hard and deserve a reward. If you can't take time off right now, at least contact a travel agent or do some research online. Surround yourself with pamphlets and images of foreign cities. Even though you know you can't travel to them now, you know you will get there soon.
 ----- 
 Today, Aquarius, you're likely to undertake some seemingly urgent decorating projects in order to get your home in tip
 ----- 
 If you aren't traveling today, Pisces, you will likely take a big trip soon. It seems that you will be sharing a room with someone special. A close friend or significant other may accompany you. You can look forward to all the romantic possibilities that come with exploring new lands together. It's bound to be a wonderful trip.
 ----- 
 Discussions with close friends could lead to ideas for creative projects of some kind, Aries. Although the projects themselves may center on writing, music, drama, graphics, or teaching, today's brainstorming is likely to center more on business and marketing than artistic matters. Nonetheless, you could walk away feeling inspired and motivated. Write down your ideas.
 ----- 
 Money matters might require your attention today, Taurus. Concerns involving the home are on your mind. You may need to work on the household accounts or balance the records of a home business. You may put in more time than necessary. Don't assume the worst! All should be basically well, so you probably could just balance the accounts and move on. You have other things to do, too!
 ----- 
 Deep thought that occupies your time today could lead to some fascinating conversations with a close friend or partner, Gemini. Lots of deas and useful information could be discussed and lead to new projects, perhaps involving writing or teaching. You will want to research every possible contingency before making definite plans, so get busy. You don't want to pass up a lucrative opportunity.
 ----- 
 Today your imagination is likely to be flying high, Cancer, drawing on past images and events that you may have forgotten. You may wonder about the commercial potential of your thoughts. A conversation with a friend who knows this subject could prove enlightening. Write your ideas down and learn as much as you can about your various options over the next few days. You might be surprised!
 ----- 
 A friend could put forth some ideas regarding incorporating the arts into a business enterprise, Leo. A lot of discussion could result, though it's unlikely that any final decisions will be made now. More ideas should come over the next few days. Some intense research on your end should shed some light on the workability of the project. Go to it!
 ----- 
 Imagination and insights definitely advance a project today, Virgo. Discussions, perhaps involving money, spur you and your collaborators on to new innovative projects that might prove to be of great benefit to all. Don't let your inspiration stop there. Let the ideas and images spur you on toward new enterprises and horizons. Make the most of them in every possible way.
 ----- 
 Friends who have been traveling or live far away could bring some interesting news your way that hasn't yet broken in your area, Libra. This might make you curious to do some research on the subject. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt until you determine the facts for yourself. Things can get garbled in translation when you hear things second or third hand.
 ----- 
 Today you might give some thought to career matters, Scorpio. You're probably trying to brainstorm ingenious ways to advance professionally and increase your income. A number of different options might present themselves, some workable, some not. It might not be easy to put them into action, but keep trying. Obstacles always arise when you're trying something new. You will get there.
 ----- 
 Your partner may return from a journey today, Sagittarius, and a deep conversation could follow. Your friend will share stories of the trip, which could lead to talk about the relationship's future. Nothing is apt to be decided. The discussion is more likely to focus on generalities than specifics. You will gain a stronger understanding of your partner and how things could shape up.
 ----- 
 Today you may feel a little out of sorts, Capricorn, but your creative energies are likely to flow freely. Inspiration could come from deep within you. You're probably more focused than usual, and therefore can spend considerable time working on a task or project without getting restless. Give free rein to your ideas. They might seem a bit dark and strange at first, but they're important.
 ----- 
 The survival of a partnership could depend on some open and honest communication today, Aquarius. Conflicting issues may be simmering and need to be aired in a sensitive and caring way. It's vital to express the affection you feel for your partner and the importance of this partnership to you. The conversation may not be an easy one, but you will feel better for it by day's end.
 ----- 
 A book, letter, or other important piece of paperwork that was misplaced might finally be found today, Pisces. This is important, as it may relate to financial concerns or a creative project that you've been working on. The information it contains should motivate you to move ahead and put this matter to rest. Much of your day could be spent dealing with this. Go to it!
 ----- 
 The healing of some childhood traumas could be triggered today, Aries, perhaps through contact with someone who knew you then. Don't be surprised if you shed a few tears. This is a normal release. You could also suddenly laugh like crazy. Once this is all done, take your friend out for the evening and kick up your heels. That will help you lighten up and enable you to sleep.
 ----- 
 Some great news could come today, Taurus, perhaps from a love partner. It might concern your relationship or it might involve some sort of good fortune coming to either you or your beloved. This bit of luck could free both of you in some way to further advance the relationship somehow. Don't panic and don't overanalyze it. Follow your heart!
 ----- 
 Have you been working very hard to increase your income? If so, Gemini, results might finally manifest. More available income usually necessitates working even harder, but in your case, you might be able to relax for a while and thus rid yourself of all the stress and tension that's been building up. Thank your lucky stars, and make plans for your free time.
 ----- 
 Today, Cancer, you should feel especially attractive, romantic, and sexy. Any current or potential romantic partner you encounter will probably pay you lots of attention and want to make plans for the two of you to get together. This might be just what you need, as the last few days may have been difficult. Get out of the house and have a little fun. Everyone needs to do this now and then!
 ----- 
 Intuition could prove extremely valuable when it comes to dealing with a sticky situation, Leo. You know all the rules, you know all the proper methods for whatever you do, but today you could be driven to make decisions based on gut feelings rather than rules or logic. Think of it as a valuable new tool for understanding how to deal with people and make the most of it.
 ----- 
 Some gossip about a friend who has recently begun a new relationship could reach you today, Virgo. This might come as a surprise, as you'd never have expected it of this person. You will be glad, because you want your friend to be happy. Don't be afraid to call and ask to hear all about it. It will be a pleasure for both of you!
 ----- 
 Minor changes in your money situation could make for a beautiful day, Libra. Perhaps you discover a bank error in your favor, get repaid for a loan, or receive a generous gift. Whichever it is, it's likely to make it possible for you to make a purchase you've been thinking you had to postpone for a while. Enjoy your good fortune and make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Today you might feel as though your mind is exploding, Scorpio. If you've been studying an intellectual or spiritual subject, insights could be coming thick and fast. Concepts that never made sense to you before suddenly seem clear. You will need to write them down, because even an elephant wouldn't be able to remember this many ideas and revelations. Make the most of them!
 ----- 
 Emotions and memories that have been buried in your psyche could suddenly well up today, Sagittarius. At first you might not be able to make sense of this. These memories could seem irrelevant to your present life. Still, a little reflection might reveal why you're recalling them now. Release whatever blockages these memories may have been causing. You could find your life changed in a subtle way.
 ----- 
 Today a friendship could develop into something more, Capricorn. Someone you know fairly well but never thought of as a potential lover could suddenly show a romantic interest in you and you could respond. Whether or not you choose to do anything about it depends on you. Circumstances and people change. Think twice before you dismiss this person. Don't do it because they're "just" a friend.
 ----- 
 A change in your working circumstances could make a positive difference to you, Aquarius. Perhaps you've moved to another desk, room, floor, or building. Whichever it is, you will be less stressed out. Being near difficult people or sitting near a window where you can see out can recharge your batteries and make you more productive.
 ----- 
 Some intellectual knowledge that you gain today is apt to make a significant difference in whatever creative projects you're working on, Pisces. A friend or partner could help in some way. A current enterprise may go in a new direction or you could start a new project. Whatever it is, expect to feel inspired. Don't be surprised at the exceptional quality of your work!
 ----- 
 A long phone conversation could take place between you and a romantic partner, Aries. You could discuss philosophy, current events, the weather, and your opinions. The only thing you probably won't touch on is the status of your relationship, which could be frustrating for you. Nonetheless, you will learn a lot about your feelings that will enable you to understand each other better.
 ----- 
 Creative work could require more focus and concentration than usual today, Taurus. You might need to do some in
 ----- 
 Some young visitors may come to your home today, Gemini. You could unexpectedly find yourself called upon to entertain them. You don't usually like to be the center of attention, but on this occasion you might enjoy it. You could direct some games or tell a story or two. Whatever you do, both you and your guests should have a great time. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Today you might receive intense telepathic communications from someone you don't know very well, Cancer. This might be symptomatic of strong ESP abilities, or it might be that this person is sending out distress signals to everyone he or she knows. If you feel comfortable with the idea, you might try to get to know the person a little better. This person could need a friend right now.
 ----- 
 Some intense work you've done in the past that you might have forgotten about could have caught the attention of someone in authority, Leo. Some long
 ----- 
 A strange conversation could take place with someone you don't know well, Virgo. He or she could be an acquaintance from work or someone who's just arrived from far away. The talk could outline new career possibilities that you've never considered but find appealing. You might spend time thinking about it. This may be different, but these are strange times. If it feels right, look into it!
 ----- 
 Learning is apt to be your primary concern today, Libra, probably metaphysics, philosophy, history, or some other division of the humanities. You might spend a lot of time in libraries or bookstores or perhaps attend a lecture or workshop. Discussions are likely to follow, and the exchange of ideas will prove stimulating. Take copious notes and enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Some intense conversations could take place between you and a group of friends, Scorpio. These people may not be close friends when you meet up with them, but by the end of the day some of them certainly could be. You share a lot of interests with these people, you think along the same lines, and you enjoy each other's company. You will definitely see them again.
 ----- 
 Today you might concentrate on some very close work, Sagittarius, perhaps a drawing or painting, sewing, jewelry making, or creating a new recipe. You may take longer to do this than you normally do, probably because there are a lot of details involved. This is good, because you will be happy with what you do. Take occasional breaks or you could strain your eyes.
 ----- 
 This morning, Capricorn, you could see nothing but piles of papers that you have no use for. You might go through them like a house afire, wanting to clear out as much clutter as you can. This is always good. A cluttered house parallels a cluttered mind. However, make certain you at least scan each thing before you discard it. You don't want to throw something out you may need later.
 ----- 
 A study of a philosophical or metaphysical concept or perhaps an ancient or foreign culture could take up a lot of your time today, Aquarius. Your mind is especially sharp and penetrating now, so you should notice more, learn more quickly, and retain more of what you read. The only downsides are possible eyestrain and a buzzing mind. Take a walk before you go to bed.
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to host an impromptu party, Pisces, and a lot of merry and interesting people could attend. You will have a lot of fun, blow off steam, and feel pleasantly exhausted when it's over. Go for it! The only problem is one member of your household might not be up for too much noise. Try to make certain everyone keeps their voices down and don't play any loud music.
 ----- 
 A letter, call, or visit from a lover or close friend is likely to bring interesting news your way. Your creative energies are at their peak, Aries, so why not try writing, music, drawing, or painting? You will have to squeeze this creativity in between many errands, because the planets indicate you will take many short trips today.
 ----- 
 Your attractiveness and sociability are at a peak today, Taurus. Don't hesitate to put both to good use. You will shine brightly at any social occasion, whether you're the host or guest. You radiate warmth and enthusiasm. You draw people to you like a magnet. You may have some important news to share, so don't be surprised if you can't move for all the people gathered around you.
 ----- 
 All matters related to romance, love, and marriage should go well today, Gemini. You should feel especially warm and supportive. Intimate conversations will come easily and naturally. Be sure to think before you speak. There's some danger of misunderstanding, and you don't want any arguments to upset this glorious day.
 ----- 
 A group gathering you attend today could have long
 ----- 
 It's unlike you, but today you rely on your intuition to guide you through some tricky territory, Leo. You may be somewhat distressed by the behavior of the people close to you. You're at a loss to understand their thinking. You will find that when you stop thinking logically and let yourself feel emotionally, you will likely gain insight into their actions.
 ----- 
 There is considerable grumpiness in the air today, Virgo. Everyone you know seems to be in a bad mood. However, you have the charm and persistence to pull them out from under that black cloud. Pay attention to any social invitations you receive, as you're likely to make some important professional contacts if you go.
 ----- 
 A recent windfall or good news regarding money could turn your thoughts to home renovation and decorating. You might do some painting or add decorative touches to the house. Even if you don't have a fortune to spend, fresh flowers, plants, and pillows or area rugs can perk up a room. You might even shop for some new furniture. Have fun with your projects today, Libra!
 ----- 
 Some misunderstandings could cause confusion at home today, Scorpio. Your natural tact and diplomacy will certainly come in handy. Artistically, you may be inspired to work on a painting or short story that's been in your head for a while. Even though you don't pay much attention to your artistic abilities, they may be responsible for some new career opportunities coming your way.
 ----- 
 You're looking better than ever, Sagittarius. Don't think your mate hasn't noticed! Even though communication may have been a bit strained lately, all that is forgotten as you delight in each other's company. You may feel adventurous, so why not plan something a bit different for the day? Take a canoe trip down a local river or go see the new comedian in town. You will have a great time!
 ----- 
 Your inspiration and imagination are at their peak, Capricorn. You may want to try some kind of an artistic project. You're sure to be pleasantly surprised by the results. You're especially tuned in to the feelings of others, so don't hesitate to act on your intuition. Logic takes a back seat to gut instinct today!
 ----- 
 You're a sensitive and caring person, Aquarius. Today you feel especially connected to your group, even those you don't know well. Your kind nature brings healing to others and many benefits to you whether you're aware of it or not. You should be feeling happy and upbeat. You're physically fit, you look great, and you will be happy to spend the day socializing.
 ----- 
 There's a chance you will receive an early morning visitor, Pisces. While it's a surprise, it turns out to be a welcome one. This visitor is likely to come bearing gifts of some kind, either in the form of interesting news or encouraging words. Listen carefully, but beware of idle gossip. Take care not to spread rumors that you don't know to be true.
 ----- 
 A member of your household who's recovering from an illness could express appreciation for all your help, Aries. This might come as a surprise because serving your friends is second nature to you. Rest assured that whatever you've been doing has made a big difference to this person. Relax in the knowledge that you're loved, wanted, and appreciated. That can keep you going in the future.
 ----- 
 The desire to write your thoughts on a subject you've been either thinking about or possibly even researching could arise today, Taurus. If you've been thinking about trying your hand at a magazine article on this or any subject, this is the time to get started. Your mind is sharp and your self
 ----- 
 Your artistic talents could be put to good use today fixing up wherever it is that you work on, Gemini. You might want to repaint, put up new plants or pictures, or do anything else that makes the place seem a little more dressed up. This isn't just fun. Both the process of doing it and the end result should lift your mood and keep you stimulated for the next few days. Have fun!
 ----- 
 The visual arts should be of special interest to you today, Cancer. Perhaps an exhibition by a favorite artist is opening, or maybe you've decided to try drawing or painting. A friend or lover could join you in such activities. Books of great art should also prove tempting, so stay out of bookstores! Design, sewing, and interior decoration could provide outlets for this interest.
 ----- 
 Your imagination is flying high today, Leo. Whatever challenges come up, you will find ingenious solutions to them. Love matters and the creative arts could come to the forefront. This is definitely a good day to indulge your interests, whatever they are. You've worked hard and deserve some time to simply sit back and enjoy yourself. Have a great day!
 ----- 
 A phone call could come from a friend bringing great news your way today, Virgo. This could involve the success of a project of some kind that you've both been involved with. The news should definitely be significant enough to merit a celebration. You and your friend could grab some others and go out on the town. Have a little fun! Tomorrow you can get started on the next project.
 ----- 
 Today you could surprise a close friend or lover with a gift, Libra. There may be no special occasion. You may have seen something in the store that you knew he or she would like or mentioned wanting. You aren't doing this for the sake of appreciation. All the same, you will receive it. Don't play down your own kindness. Just say thanks and smile.
 ----- 
 A place far away that you haven't visited for a while yet long to see again could be on your mind today, Scorpio. You might toy with the idea of going there, but you aren't really sure if you can. Nonetheless, it certainly won't hurt to look into it. What's the plane fare? Where can you stay? Learning these facts might help later when it comes time to make the decision.
 ----- 
 You should feel especially loving now, Sagittarius, especially toward that special someone. You might want to schedule an intimate evening, perhaps at a favorite restaurant. A visit to an art gallery, concert, or play should prove informative and entertaining, and therefore provide fodder for enough conversation to get you through the evening and set the stage for the rest of the night.
 ----- 
 Organized parties, impromptu get
 ----- 
 The aura today is calm and peaceful, stress is at a minimum. You're likely to be getting along very well with your group, even the more difficult among them. As a result, you will probably accomplish a lot more together than usual. At the end of the day you will be pleased with what you've done and proud of yourself. Go to it!
 ----- 
 Love and romance are apt to be among your top priorities today, Pisces. Someone from far away might have captured your heart. You could be looking forward to getting together tonight, perhaps to attend a concert or sporting event. You should find this person's presence very healing right now. At the end of the evening, you will feel mentally and physically inspired. Have fun!
 ----- 
 A fabulous career break could come your way today, Aries. It could be a raise, promotion, or even a new job in a new field. It could also involve a completely different location. The work you will be doing may be unlike anything you've ever done before, and that's a challenge. Don't worry! Change is necessary if you're to reach your maximum potential. Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 An unexpected release of tension could come today, Taurus. Something that has been restricting you and limiting your growth is going to disappear, and you will want to run through the streets shouting. From here on out, certain desires that have eluded you could start to manifest in your life. One of them could be a new romance. What else need be said?
 ----- 
 Some strange but wonderful things could be happening to you now, Gemini. Sheer luck could well be in the picture. Have you wanted to move to a nicer place? If so, now you probably can. Have you been expecting a bonus or settlement? Today it could be yours! Even your dreams are apt to be vivid, powerful, and very beautiful. The only downside is if one of the events involves money, don't overspend!
 ----- 
 A rather black mood that's been plaguing you since early morning could suddenly disappear when a business or romantic partner brings wonderful news your way, Cancer. It could involve a goal that finally manifests that you may have given up long ago. If so, you could feel a little overwhelmed. Take some time to sit still and let it sink in before celebrating Congratulations!
 ----- 
 If you've been concerned about your health for any reason, Leo, today your medical professional could give you a clean bill of health. You will believe it, because you're likely to feel wonderful. Stress has vanished, at least for now, and your energy and enthusiasm are higher than they've been for a long time. Enjoy yourself. Go out with some friends. You've earned it!
 ----- 
 Creative energies are flowing like a river today, Virgo. Ideas for projects should come thick and fast. You can't wait to get started. You may even formulate plans to market them once they're done. Love and romance should also be going well for you, as intellectual discussions could bring you and a current or potential love partner closer. Have a wonderful day and make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Dreams should shed light on some difficult issues you've been trying to resolve, Libra. You can finally make the problems disappear. This should be more than a relief to you 
 ----- 
 More than one call could come today with absolutely wonderful news! Exciting and wonderful changes are in the wind, Scorpio, but you need to bear in mind that with the good news comes the unknown. Your life may be turned upside down. Consider if you really want to stay in the same rut for the rest of your life. Gird your loins and look forward to an adventure!
 ----- 
 A sizable sum of money could come your way today, Sagittarius, probably as a surprise. This is a significant day for you. The money will open up new doors, particularly where creativity is concerned, so the situation definitely calls for a celebration. Don't gamble or consider any kind frivolous of investment for at least two months. Treat yourself! You deserve it!
 ----- 
 Today you may wake up feeling energetic, enthusiastic, optimistic, and very happy, Capricorn. You may not be able to trace this to anything logical, so don't even try. Make the most of what's happening and use that energy to create the life you want. You might feel like you can move mountains, but for now you'd better concentrate on molehills. Be conservative now and tackle the mountains later!
 ----- 
 Have you been feeling psychic lately, Aquarius? Has a recent dream or premonition come true? Any insights that you receive today aren't likely to be clothed in complex symbolism 
 ----- 
 Today you might gather with some very smart friends at a coffee house for an intellectual conversation, Pisces. Some fascinating ideas and useful information could be exchanged. Much of what is said could inspire new creative projects. If it isn't too late, walk home and clear your head or sleep may be a bit elusive tonight!
 ----- 
 Your intuition and imagination are operating at their peak today, Aries. Don't be surprised if you get the urge to write or paint. Even if you don't have all the necessary equipment, get started anyway. Scribbles in a notebook can easily be copied onto more formal material later on. What's important today is that you get started. You're likely to produce something wonderful!
 ----- 
 Welcome back to the land of the living, Taurus. You've been so preoccupied with your existential questions lately that you've missed the point about playing the hand that life has dealt you. Now you're more in tune and present in your daily life and more able to recognize and appreciate the joy that you can find moment to moment. It's an important discovery. Well done!
 ----- 
 You may feel a little unsure of what you believe in now, Gemini. Your mind is filled with questions and contradictions. Try to realize that the journey to finding your true purpose could take a lifetime. No one else expects you to have all the answers right now, so why should you? Relax and try and enjoy moments spent with your loved ones. You may find that this is really all you need.
 ----- 
 You may be obsessed with finding your true purpose in life, Cancer. Although you may not like to admit it, this could occupy your thoughts a lot. Try not to be so stressed about it. Realize that knowing your true purpose can take many years, even a lifetime, of careful thought and observation. Try to focus on enjoying more of the daily moments. You may just stumble onto the answer you seek.
 ----- 
 You may feel rather introspective today, Leo, and decidedly out of step with everyone else's frenzied pace. You're a thoughtful person with deep spiritual beliefs. It's understandable that you may sometimes feel disheartened by all the consumerism and conspicuous consumption that fills society. Try not to let this get you down. Try to focus instead on your reasons for being happy.
 ----- 
 There are many social demands on you now, Virgo, in addition to the usual demands of home and work. This is when you need to be selfish and guard your time. If you try and accommodate everyone else's wishes, you will sacrifice your own. To truly enjoy your time with others, remember that you must fulfill your own needs first.
 ----- 
 You may feel a strong urge to run away from it all, Libra, but where would you go? The restlessness you feel may be in response to all the pressures on you now. Social demands, work requirements, and the needs of family may be pulling you to the breaking point. You can turn off your phone for the day. Pull down the blinds, cuddle up with a good book, and pretend that you're all alone.
 ----- 
 You take great pleasure in a neat, organized house, Scorpio. In your mind, cleanliness really is next to godliness. Today you may be dismayed by how rundown your home has become. It's time for some clearing out, dusting, and scrubbing. Do this yourself rather than hiring help. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much it helps you clear your head.
 ----- 
 Today you may feel out of sorts, Sagittarius. You aren't sick, just exhausted from the effort you've been putting in at work lately. This is a sign of stress and an indicator that you need a real day off from chores and personal projects. Forget the workload you'd planned for the day. If you relax, everything you don't finish today can be done tomorrow. Take the day off 
 ----- 
 Today is a domestic sort of day. You've been neglecting your home recently and now is a good time to make up for it. Clear out the clutter and get organized. If you're ambitious, you might even want to try a little cooking. Why else have you been saving magazine recipes? You will enjoy the result of getting things in order and allowing yourself the pleasure of a positive day.
 ----- 
 You're feeling extremely romantic and passionate today, Aquarius. If you've experienced a rift with your spouse or loved one, this would be the day to make amends. Why not make reservations at an intimate restaurant? A night out may be just what you need to rekindle that spark. You surely have enough passion to whip the spark into an enduring flame.
 ----- 
 You're adapting to your changing environment as quickly as you can, Pisces. You may seem a little preoccupied or distant to those around you, but this is because you actually need all of your energy to adjust. Don't worry too much about trying to please others now. You already have plenty on your mind. They're going to have to be patient!
 ----- 
 You may be a bit on edge emotionally today, Aries. You're likely to feel less self
 ----- 
 Low biorhythms may have you feeling less than your usual self, Taurus. Your mind may not be quite as quick as it usually is, and you may go through the day in a bit of a fog, possibly reflecting on the past. This isn't quite as aimless as it sounds. You might want to jot down your memories and reflections. They could shed light on something that's going on with you now.
 ----- 
 Frustrating delays in completing a project might cause you to doubt your skills, Gemini. Be careful not to fall into this trap. There's nothing wrong with your skills. Take a good long look at what you're doing and try to discern where it got hung up. Worries about money may cause you to consider postponing an activity that means a lot to you. Don't. Use your ingenuity to work it out.
 ----- 
 Even though you're likely to wake up feeling energetic and enthusiastic, Cancer, your mood may sink a little when you think about all you need to do. It may be time to question whether you should make some significant changes. Are the walls closing in on you? If so, perhaps you should look for an opportunity that gives you more freedom of movement or perhaps gets you outside part of the time.
 ----- 
 An increased awareness of subtle undercurrents may have you feeling a bit disconcerted today, Leo. You could experience clairvoyant or telepathic abilities you didn't know you had. As you usually like to be down to Earth and realistic, this may throw you for a loop, but try to flow with it. Reality isn't necessarily limited to what is perceived by the usual five senses!
 ----- 
 The desire to perform a service of some kind could attract you to group activities today, Virgo. You might attend a meeting of a group you aren't yet familiar with, and you could feel like a fifth wheel. Take heart! You will catch on soon, and the people in the group are likely to take to you. Your insights should prove valuable to them, and they will be quick to notice that!
 ----- 
 Your day could be worrisome and stressful, Libra. Your workload may be especially heavy and you could be putting in some long hours. Relations with others might also be a bit tense. Ease the stress by playing music and take frequent breaks. Have a good meal at lunchtime and then take a walk. Things are likely to be a lot more laid back tomorrow!
 ----- 
 Today you're likely to feel rather bored, restless, and frustrated with the way your life is going now, Scorpio. You have responsibilities that need meeting, yet you have other projects that interest you a lot more than mundane tasks. As a result, you might find yourself growing a bit impatient with those around you. Don't take your frustrations out on others! Remember, "This, too, shall pass."
 ----- 
 You may feel especially sexy and passionate, Sagittarius, but minor conflicts between you and the special someone in your life could put distance between you. You can avoid this by being patient and making an effort to communicate. You could be tempted to overspend, probably on items you don't particularly need now and may not even want. Take care to curb impulse spending.
 ----- 
 Nervous tension among family members is high today, Capricorn, so don't be surprised if household members start quarreling. It's best to keep them apart most of the day if you can. In the evening, encourage them to talk about what's bothering them. You may be feeling a bit bored and discouraged, but forget about it by keeping busy. This will all pass by tomorrow.
 ----- 
 Information gleaned today might not be totally accurate, Aquarius. Someone may be repeating gossip or making stories up out of whole cloth. Listen if you want, but don't pass along anything you hear unless you know for a fact that it's true. Your workload might be especially heavy and you might have a deadline, so you have a ready excuse not to pay any attention!
 ----- 
 Pessimism over money matters may plague you today, Pisces. Perhaps a desired increase in income hasn't materialized, or you've been hoping to make a particular purchase that you still can't quite afford. This might be the time to put your ingenuity to work and come up with a contingency plan to earn the money you need. You will be able to find good opportunities. It beats waiting!
 ----- 
 Too many communications may prove distracting today, Aries. The phone could be ringing off the hook and your email inbox overflowing. Everyone around you seems to be talking at once. If you don't bring some order to this chaos, it could give you a headache! Let voicemail get the phone, get away from the computer, and take something light to the park to read. You need some peace and quiet.
 ----- 
 A sudden but necessary expense could make a big hole in your budget today, Taurus. Perhaps some repairs need to be made around the house or to the car. Maybe someone needs an unexpected trip to the dentist. This could throw you off balance, but you can manage it by cutting some corners. So what if you have to eat pasta for a week or two? It could be worse! Just move ahead with whatever needs to be done.
 ----- 
 Generally you're pretty emotionally stable, Gemini. Today's events might seem to conspire to create erratic moods that you aren't used to feeling. No major concerns should arise, but little irritations like dropping things, misplacing keys, or missing calls could get on your nerves. Slow down and stay focused. It's the only way you will remain calm today.
 ----- 
 If you've been studying astrology, numerology, or any other occult science, Cancer, today you might find some of the concepts you're studying a bit confusing. You may have glossed over some of the ideas that are prerequisites to what you're looking at now. Go back and review last week's lesson and everything might make more sense to you. You will probably progress that much faster for doing this.
 ----- 
 A friend could be having financial troubles and ask you for a loan, Leo. You like this person and understand what he or she's going through, so you want to help. But it could be a while before your friend is solvent again. If you make the loan, remember the adage about never lending anything to a friend that you aren't willing to consider a gift. Don't depend on immediate repayment.
 ----- 
 Some equipment that you use a lot, perhaps an appliance, computer, or TV, might go on the blink today, Virgo. Don't try to fix it yourself even if you think you know how. Call a professional, and hang the expense. If you try to do it yourself, you might cause more damage to the equipment or perhaps to you! This is definitely a day to exercise caution. Be patient!
 ----- 
 Some rather bizarre news could come to you today about metaphysical or paranormal matters, Libra. This isn't anything that affects you directly, but more likely concerns discoveries of anomalies. You and others could find it fascinating and discuss it for hours. Don't be surprised if the theories that come up seem even more bizarre than what you heard in the first place!
 ----- 
 This could be a hectic day, Scorpio. You will probably try to go too many places and do too many things at once. Friends might want to get together, but you may have a lot of errands to take care of. It might be a good idea to assess what needs to be done and take care of it in order of urgency. That's the only way you can stay sane!
 ----- 
 You might hear some rather bizarre rumors today, Sagittarius. Someone has misinterpreted a piece of information and blown it into something far different from reality. You will need to check this out for yourself before jumping to any conclusions. Don't be afraid to pass on what you learn. It's better to nip this sort of gossip in the bud by revealing the facts than let it continue to spread.
 ----- 
 Today you might plan a quick trip by air, Capricorn. This could be business related. Someone else may have been meant to go but couldn't, so you may be taking his or her place. This could be disruptive for you, but if you make an effort, you can turn it into an adventure. It's always best to go with the flow and make the most of it.
 ----- 
 A date to get together with a romantic partner might have to be broken at the last minute, Aquarius. Your friend might not give a reason, and you might wonder if this means he or she doesn't really want to see you. That probably isn't the case. All signs are that your friend has received some bad news and didn't want to upset you. Hang in there. You should hear from your honey again soon.
 ----- 
 Sudden and unexpected problems could have your household in chaos, Pisces. This probably doesn't relate to difficulties with your housemates. It's more likely to involve problems with wiring, appliances, or phone lines. It could be annoying to deal with repairmen in and out of your house, but you will have to bear with it. You want your household back to normal as soon as possible.
 ----- 
 Your gracious, tender nature is likely to be extremely appreciated today, Aries. You may feel as if your head is so far up in the clouds that you can't get anything done. The truth of the matter is that the work you need to do is actually found up in those clouds. Trust that you've taken care of the foundation. The thing you need to do now is relax and let your fantasies lead the way.
 ----- 
 If you need to do errands, Taurus, don't drag others along with you. Complete your mission solo. You will find that you're more efficient if you don't have to carry the extra burden around. Not only will you get your chores done more quickly but you will also have time to think and process certain things without someone else's energy influencing your thinking.
 ----- 
 Don't take no for an answer today, Gemini. Chances are you won't have to. People will be more understanding of your situation and have compassion for your cause. Your inner strength will show through loud and clear, and you have the desire to make anything happen you want. There's a lucky star smiling on you that's helping you tackle any project.
 ----- 
 It may be difficult to deal with people who seem spaced out and confused today, Cancer. This confusion can be contagious. You will find that no matter how much logic you apply to the situation, if it doesn't feel right, it won't happen. Things will flow naturally or they won't flow at all. Ease into the relaxed atmosphere of the day and don't worry if things don't happen as quickly as you'd like.
 ----- 
 Take your mind off your stressful duties and responsibilities today, Leo. This is a time for emotions and ego to connect in harmony. Don't let other people's problems ruin your good mood. There's a need for you to consciously let your mind and body be at ease. Art and music will bring you a great deal of pleasure. Indulge in the things that make you truly happy.
 ----- 
 All the knowledge in the world will be no match for the emotional energy in the air on a day like today, Virgo. You may be carried away into a mystical realm where feelings take precedence over facts. Let go of reality for a while and free yourself from the hectic pace of everyday life. There's a strong pull toward the fantasy realm today, so feel free to go there.
 ----- 
 Treat yourself to something special, Libra, whether a gourmet meal, new outfit, or latest gadget. Today is your day and you shouldn't deprive yourself of anything. There's a remarkable synchronicity of events that will lead you to exactly the right place at the right time. There's a special warmth and sensitivity in the air that will put your mind and emotions at ease.
 ----- 
 There's an emotional, sensual feeling to the day that is sure to tickle your heart, Scorpio. Try not to be too abrasive when dealing with others. The more serene you can be, the more doors you will be able to walk through. Be patient and don't feel like you need to be first in line. If you aren't sure of a situation, don't jump in headfirst.
 ----- 
 The different parts of your personality should work harmoniously today, Sagittarius. It's important that there be an equal amount of give and take in your world. If for some reason there's an imbalance in a certain area of your life, address the issue right away. It's important that you maintain equilibrium within yourself and with the people around you.
 ----- 
 You probably aren't going to impress people with your fast talk and quick facts today, Capricorn. You will likely get further if you express the emotions that lie behind your words. It's more important to say what you feel than what you think. Even though this may go against your usual nature, you will find that it's the best policy on a day like this.
 ----- 
 Your ego should be strengthened by your emotions, and vice versa, today. Be yourself in every capacity and situation, Aquarius. Things should flow quite smoothly for you as long as you keep the energy moving within you. Share your feelings honestly with others and you will find that your inner vitality strengthens. No one will be able to speak against words that come straight from your heart.
 ----- 
 Like a surfer who wants to ride the endless wave, you must first prepare yourself before you jump into the ocean with your board, Pisces. Sit on the real or imaginary beach for a while and contemplate the tide. Watch the currents and see how other surfers fare under the prevailing conditions. You will find that the more preparation you do, the more secure you will be when you hit the water.
 ----- 
 You have a unique opportunity to review plans and foundations that you've recently put into place, Aries. As carpenters say, "Measure twice and cut once." This is a key time to review your plans and make sure your structure is secure. If there's any doubt about what you've completed so far, consult someone whose expertise you trust. It may be worth it to start over using a new plan.
 ----- 
 Your laziness isn't making it easy to get out of bed, Taurus. In fact, all you may want to do today is absolutely nothing. Unfortunately, this may not be possible. Whether it is or not, you can make the best of this feeling as long as you keep yourself in the right frame of mind. Find the element of fun in everything you do, including your work.
 ----- 
 You may but heads with someone who's equally unwilling to budge, Gemini. Use this conflict as a lesson in perspective. Understand the motivation of the opposite side. The life lesson you may need to learn probably has to do with discipline and the need for honest sweat from your brow. Don't be afraid to work a little harder than you have been to make your dreams come true.
 ----- 
 You may run into roadblocks today, Cancer, but don't worry. These are things you are capable of working around. The tricky part of the situation is that none of these blocks is likely to budge, and you may have absolutely no understanding of why they're there. Try not to take this barricade personally.
 ----- 
 Your mind is sharp today, and your willingness to work is equally strong, Leo. Use this powerful combination of forces to your full advantage. You will find that your brain is like a powerful steel trap. There is very little that will escape your attention. The most important thing for you to remember is to not let other people obstruct your progress.
 ----- 
 You may get out of bed with a jolt, Virgo, indicative of the fact that there are forces prodding you from almost every direction. It may seem like you're in high demand, so do your best to appease those who need your attention. The key for you is not to get overwhelmed to the point where you can no longer function at all. Go at your own pace and you will meet with tremendous success.
 ----- 
 It isn't a good idea to blame your troubles on others, Libra. The only one that you really have to blame is you. You will find that your mind is active today and that it might send you around in circles unless you make a conscious effort to slow it down and get it going on the right path. Deal with the facts of the situation instead of the emotions that may arise from it.
 ----- 
 Today it may seem like you're trapped in a power struggle that you can't get out of, Scorpio. The problem is that this struggle may have very little to do with you and your actions. There's a strong, limiting force that is asking you to slow down. Try your best not to get involved with conflicts that don't concern you.
 ----- 
 Your solid, grounded, and steady approach may be challenged today, Sagittarius. Someone with a strong ego could punch holes in the plan you've so carefully laid out. Try to stick with the facts and do your best not to let this turn into some sort of popularity contest. Be humble and direct. Try not to be too emotional or sensitive.
 ----- 
 Take care that your self
 ----- 
 Your self
 ----- 
 You may be a bit aggravated today, Pisces. People seem to be more of a hindrance than a help to you. Don't be too accusatory until you make sure that you're operating honestly and productively. You may automatically go into defensive mode and end up accusing someone of the very thing that you're guilty of.
 ----- 
 Expect some changes in your household today, Aries. You could finally be making some repairs or remodeling or redecorating. It's also possible that someone could move in or out.

There's likely to be a lot of activity!

 You're a sociable person with a gift for small talk and interesting discussions. Today you will find some amazing information that will keep your conversations fascinating for months.

 You could be planning a major journey of some kind, Cancer. It may be a long vacation or travel to foreign countries, or it could be an intellectual or spiritual journey into new schools of thought. Your mind is sharp now, so you will learn quickly and retain more. This is a good time to play detective, or perhaps you will simply want to lose yourself in a good mystery novel.
 ----- 
 You're practical and down to Earth, Leo. Today your intuition is more active than usual. You might receive some powerful messages from the higher planes that open up new doors for you. Don't ignore them. Think about what's in them before you accept or reject them. You could also tune in more strongly than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others.
 ----- 
 Travel by air seems possible today, Virgo. The appeal of foreign countries may be too strong to resist. If you don't have a passport, you'd better apply! Friends may be planning a trip abroad and invite you to accompany them. Your sense of adventure should ensure that you won't say no, but if you're tempted to for any reason, reconsider! Travel is important to you right now.
 ----- 
 The Universe is encouraging you to listen today, Libra. This isn't a day for polemic speeches. It isn't a day to try to win others over to your point of view.

Write down your thoughts and go over them later.
 ----- 
 An invitation to a social event in your neighborhood could put you in touch with artistic or spiritually inclined people. There could be some fascinating exchanges, Cancer.

 ----- 
 Romance should pick up speed today, Virgo. You could discover that you and a current or potential romantic partner have many spiritual interests in common.

Schedule a few and stick to your plans.
 ----- 
 You might have intense dreams and visions tonight that could be almost prophetic, Libra. These premonitions could be personal, but they're apt to be more worldly, such as political events or something in the life of a celebrity you admire. What you sense should be positive, so there are no warnings involved. Write them down so you can verify them later. You might be surprised!
 ----- 
 A lecture given by a magnetic speaker could excite your imagination and interest you in a new and intriguing field, Scorpio.

 ----- 
 A friend or colleague could introduce you to a way to increase your income by doing what you love most, Sagittarius.

Check out the facts and think about it. If you still like it, go for it!
 ----- 
 Enthusiasm for spiritual and metaphysical studies could have you feeling optimistic about the future.

Friends could want to join you in this activity. Let the insights flow, and write them down.
 ----- 
 Today you might want to host a meeting of your metaphysically inclined friends, Aquarius. Discussions could lead to insights that none of you would have come up with alone.

 ----- 
 The more tightly you try to hang onto something, Gemini, the more likely it is it will want to slip through your fingers. Grab what you want, but don't squeeze too hard.

 ----- 
 Recent events in the love and romance department may have you feeling like you aren't getting your needs met, Libra. Remember that other people aren't mind readers the way you are. If someone's behavior isn't right with you, say so. Romantic partnerships should uplift and support your dreams, not something you make personal sacrifices for just to maintain.
 ----- 
 Be careful that you aren't manipulating a romantic situation so your partner loses any power, Scorpio. You may think your actions are noble and well meaning, but you may be creating a scenario that has no basis in reality. People could be impressionable, but that doesn't mean you should take advantage of this by promoting your own interests at the expense of another's.
 ----- 
 Things in the love department may be looking up for you, Sagittarius, but beware that you aren't getting pushed around. Your partner could feel the need for more freedom in the relationship, while you're hoping to find more commitment. Take it one day at a time. Don't get ahead of yourself by projecting scenarios that may not come to fruition. You're only setting yourself up for disappointment.
 ----- 
 You may find that you're indecisive when it comes to issues concerning love and romance, Capricorn.

In fact, if you do, this commitment may cause you more frustration later.
 ----- 
 Try to get more grounded in your actions regarding love and romance, Aquarius. You may need to take a more reserved approach in your actions in order to get where you need to go. At the same time, however, your freedom
 ----- 
 You're quite sure of yourself and solid about many things except one. When it comes to romantic relationships, you feel a bit unsure and inadequate, Pisces.

Figure out your needs before you make long
 ----- 
 Being of service to others is important, Aries, but make sure that you're taking care of yourself, too. Turn up the heat and let yourself expand into other worlds today.

 ----- 
 If there is an imbalance in your relationship with someone close, it's important to take a stand now, Taurus. Make sure you speak your mind with conviction. The stakes are higher when people's egos are involved, as they will be today. You're the air that fuels the fire, so be careful of which way you direct your energy.
 ----- 
 There could be a great deal of friction in your world today, Gemini, as stubborn minds aggressively come into conflict with each other.

Think twice about using your aggressive nature at the expense of others.
 ----- 
 Things should go nicely for you today, Cancer. You will find that the brighter you shine, the more prosperity will come your way. Things should flow smoothly, and your mind will be clear and strong. There is a marked aggressiveness to your nature that is powerful and effective.

 ----- 
 You may need to make some mental adjustments in order to get on the same wavelength as other people today, Leo. You may not see what all the fuss is about. Don't take things too seriously and don't feel like you need to make sense of every detail that presents itself. Some things are best left unknown. Enjoy the diversity in your world and respect the differences in other people's approaches.
 ----- 
 There may be important lessons about balance that come up today, Virgo. Make sure you're ready to handle the fire, because it will be coming at you. Egos are large, and everyone is going to have an opinion on everything. Tension may exist, but this doesn't mean you should back down from your position. Be flexible and understanding, but don't necessarily assume that you're wrong.
 ----- 
 The events of the day might leave you feeling a bit confused and bewildered, Libra. Perhaps you're feeling like you aren't getting the attention you feel you deserve. You may wonder why the one thing you want the most may be the one thing you can't have. You have more than you think you do. No one wants to be with someone who's moping and depressed. Let your internal light shine brightly.
 ----- 
 This is a terrific day for you, Scorpio. You will find that your mind and your urge for action are on the same page. The fire within you is raging hot. Use this aggressive internal urge to tackle projects that require courage, strength, and a flair for the dramatic. You will find that you're more than able to accomplish everything you want to accomplish today.
 ----- 
 Feel free to be a bit more selfish than usual, Sagittarius. You might find yourself turning inside out in order to get your point across. Attend to your dreams and ambitions and let your voice be heard by the crowd. Don't be surprised if you meet opposition, but don't take this as a sign that you should back down. Stand up for your needs!
 ----- 
 You might find that your desire to conquer is active today, Capricorn, and that your mind is right in line with the urge to take action. Listen to this and stoke the internal fire. You will find that you can increase your circle of influence by a great deal as long as you're willing to take a decisive risk in how you approach every situation. Be bold and courageous in your actions.
 ----- 
 You might find it necessary to give yourself a bit of self
 ----- 
 This is a terrific day for you, Pisces. You can accomplish a great deal when you set your mind in motion. There's a strong, warlike instinct within you that's fired up and ready to fight. Leave your worries at the doorstep, because there's no need to hesitate on a day like this. Your kingdom is ready for you. Be strong and remember that the best way to lead people is to walk behind them.
 ----- 
 You may find that your instincts are right, Aries, particularly where other people are concerned. You and a friend could come up with the same words at the same time, which might be a little disconcerting for both of you. Still, this increased intuition is likely to help your understanding of those close to you more than you ever expected. Make the most of it, and remember what you learn.
 ----- 
 Social events and group activities could bring new interests your way that provide a rich field of knowledge for you to delve into, Taurus. Someone could recommend books on the subject. This could be very exciting, especially since a lot of new people who share this interest could come into your life. Be sure to keep track of names and phone numbers. You won't want to lose touch.
 ----- 
 A number of people involved in the healing professions could cross your path today, Gemini. You might hear news about recent discoveries in those fields that sparks your interest. What you learn could affect your life in a profoundly positive way, so you need to write down not only the contact information for the people you meet but also the resources they use.
 ----- 
 A potential new love partner could show up, Cancer, perhaps someone from a distant state or foreign country or in a field like law or education. You could have a lot of interests in common with this person. Some intriguing discussions could result. Whether you choose to pursue this attraction depends on your situation, but you can enjoy this person's company today anyway. Tomorrow 
 ----- 
 Family members could spring some surprising news on you today, Leo. This news may concern people you know or perhaps a family member has some interesting plans of his or her own that you weren't aware of. Although positive, this news could throw you for a loop. It should definitely cause you to alter your thinking in some way. Don't let emotion overwhelm logic right now.
 ----- 
 Invitations to some exciting social events in your neighborhood could come today, Virgo. You might hear from some friends who are planning to attend, so you could be enthusiastically looking forward to these events. You will enjoy getting together with your friends. Bear in mind that you could also meet new people who prove to be valuable business contacts. Make sure you look your best!
 ----- 
 Good news involving a small, extra sum of money could come today, Libra. You might receive a check in the mail. Take a friend out to lunch. You will both have fun. Afterward, you may want to blow the rest of the money on something frivolous, but don't go that far. Think about one or more items you want and concentrate on those.
 ----- 
 Bonding is today's keyword, Scorpio. Relations with close friends should be enhanced by increased communication, perhaps some fascinating conversations about new ideas and exciting world events. This new intellectual rapport could bring you closer than you were before. Romantic relationships, in particular, intensify through newly discovered mutual interests, perhaps involving foreign cultures.
 ----- 
 A lot of unfinished tasks may need doing around the home today, Sagittarius. You might decide to ignore some of the work that desperately needs to be handled in favor of a project that you think you will enjoy more. Don't stick family members with the boring stuff! If you pull together to get the worst out of the way, then you can all have fun with the more interesting tasks.
 ----- 
 Some great news about a friend's good fortune could be exciting, Capricorn, and you might spend a lot of time on the phone not only congratulating that friend but also discussing it with other people. This is good for you, as you're apt to find it inspiring and use it as motivation to continue pushing ahead yourself. In fact, this news could change your life profoundly in the long run.
 ----- 
 When it comes to managing money today, Aquarius, you should go with your gut, whether it involves personal finances, job
 ----- 
 A new fascination with history or an exotic culture could drive you to learn more about it, Pisces. It could become an obsession, for today at least. You might spend a lot of time online or in the library or talking to people who specialize in this field. By day's end, your mind could be spinning like a top. Take a walk and clear your head or you might not be able to sleep.
 ----- 
 The good news is this 
 ----- 
 Today rethink all the social values you take at face value. Like the rest of us, you learned them at an early age and accepted them unthinkingly. Established concepts of propriety are especially deserving of consideration. After hearing for years about all those things that "just aren't done," isn't it refreshing to think that maybe they should be done after all?
 ----- 
 Today is an ideal day to shop for a new wardrobe. You may find your usual style too conventional or uncomfortably trendy. Sometimes you reject outfits you really like out of fear they're too suggestive, old fashioned, or something else. Perhaps you should listen to your good judgment for a change instead of being so concerned about what other people might think.
 ----- 
 The topic of the day is knowledge and learning. Did you study the field you really wanted to? Do you feel bad about not having attended such
 ----- 
 The planetary alignment is favorable, and you're in the process of reaping the benefits, Leo. It was only a matter of becoming aware of and settling certain matters related to your need for social recognition. Don't be so hungry for approval, Leo. Everybody contains a stern inner parent and can survive comfortably in total self
 ----- 
 You may feel hemmed in by the role models society currently offers. As you struggle to reach your own definition of the truly innovative achiever, other people sometimes criticize your rather liberated attitude. Just because your ideas aren't in sync with theirs in no way invalidates them. If your ideas are too radical, theirs are too conventional. There's room for both viewpoints.
 ----- 
 The results of the recent planetary influence are coming home to roost, Libra. If everything went according to plan, you gained some insight into your ego. Buddhist wise men say that the path to spiritual fulfillment lies in knowing how to build a healthy ego while developing a part of oneself completely foreign to the ego. Are you working hard at this?
 ----- 
 A small crisis is still a crisis, isn't it, Scorpio? You can expect one in your personal life today. Since you aren't the kind of person who lets issues go unresolved, you won't be able to put off dealing with your problems any longer. Are responsibilities shared equally with your partner? Are you each making an equal effort to maintain harmony? Asking the questions is the first step to answering them.
 ----- 
 Something has to change. You knew it as soon as you woke up this morning. Your mirror provides the impetus for important resolutions today. Is it time to begin a diet, commit to exercising more, or strengthen your resolve to quit smoking? Anything you do to improve your appearance will make you feel a lot better about yourself. Buy some new clothes or get a haircut. People will notice.
 ----- 
 The only good thing about being on an emotional roller coaster is that you never feel the same way for long. One moment you're up, the next you're down. You can't figure out what it is you want. Rather than drag your loved ones along on the ride, get away from your usual environment. You will be a lot better off alone. And something more important may come out of these moments of solitude!
 ----- 
 You might want to check your alarm clock to be sure it really woke you up this morning. Your tendency today will be to stay in the cocoon of your little dream world, deep in your own thoughts. Obsessive thoughts, in particular, will try and drown out some more pressing issues from the past that need resolution once and for all. Ring! It's time to wake up!
 ----- 
 There's something in the air pushing you toward change or renewal. Is it time to change your wardrobe or redecorate your home? If so, today's the day. If you have a budget, you will find it just as fulfilling (and a lot cheaper) to rid your home of all the things that just aren't "you" anymore. Surround yourself with things you love.
 ----- 
 You might feel more energetic than you have in a long time, Aries. The day's planetary aspects offer a powerful energy that will increase your mental acuity and physical strength, and this can really help you tackle and finish any tasks that have been piling up. If you manage to accomplish so much that you have time to spare, help others lighten their load. Tend to your own first, however.
 ----- 
 If there's something you want to take on, Taurus, today's the day. The celestial aspects will see an increase in physical and mental strength that can work wonders for you. Put any insecurity or lack of confidence in the trash, and take the steps you need to tackle your project or goal. You have the ability to make sound judgments, so put your trust in this talent. Take steps to get what you want.
 ----- 
 If you've been feeling sluggish lately, Gemini, today will see a surge in energy that will greatly increase your creativity and physical strength. Seize the opportunity to get into the fresh air for a sports activity or long walk. Exercise can direct your physical energy and give your mind a chance to clear. Don't be surprised if you discover more clarity and focus afterward. Make the most of it.
 ----- 
 Cancer, if there's something interesting that you want to try, go for it. Adventure brings excitement, creative flow, and energy, and these are essential to you. Yours is a highly artistic nature. Continual stimulation is required to keep your psyche healthy. Experience something new today. Even if it's just a walk to a place you've never been, it will give you the adrenaline you need.
 ----- 
 Today's energy will help you take steps toward getting things in order, Leo. Tackle the drawers, closets, storage rooms, and cabinets. Organization is a good activity for today. Creating order brings a sense of peace and personal control. Mental organization like goal setting, budgeting, or scheduling will add to this feeling. Sift through and clean out as many corners as you can.
 ----- 
 The energy of the day makes you ready for almost anything, Virgo. Given your sometimes radical approach to whatever you do, you may need to rein yourself in. You also have a humanitarian approach to life. If the pursuit of your wants hurts others, it could create serious internal conflict. With this high energy, think your plans through before taking action to remain true to your values.
 ----- 
 Today may be an excellent time to take a second shot at something that didn't work out the first time, Libra. Falling flat on your face can damage your confidence and self
 ----- 
 Your ability to find innovative approaches to tasks may serve you well today, Scorpio. Today is full of added energy and mental acuity. You will find that most things come easily. With detail
 ----- 
 If long
 ----- 
 Don't worry about being productive today, Capricorn. Thanks to the high energy provided by the planetary aspects, it might be one of the most efficient days you've had for a long time. Dig in your heels and go, go, go. Things will be accomplished in no time flat, with some to spare at that. If you have a creative hobby, enjoy working on it. You will find it rewarding.
 ----- 
 Expect an added boost to your physical energy today, Aquarius. It's an excellent day to clean out closets and storage rooms. Some exercise like biking or walking will be most enjoyable. It may also prove to be well worth your while to sit down and look at your goals. Are you where you wanted to be at this stage of your life? Are there changes that need to be made? Exercise both your brain and body.
 ----- 
 If certain projects or tasks have seemed difficult to finish, take advantage of the energy provided by today's planetary aspects. This energy will give you all the zip you need, Pisces. It's a good time to meet with others to discuss important matters. Your communication and cooperation skills will be increased. You can make decisions much more quickly than usual. Have a productive day!
 ----- 
 Are you satisfied with your current career, Aries? If not, start by making a plan. There are specific steps that you can follow to take the greatest advantage of the available opportunities. Consider visiting career
 ----- 
 Don't fear any changes that lie ahead, Taurus. Even if you think you don't adjust well, you have more adaptability than you realize. Without change, life would become stagnant. It wouldn't be long before you became dissatisfied and bored with the same old thing. Try to see change as an adventure and a gateway to greater happiness and fulfillment. Trust your versatility.
 ----- 
 Make your dreams a tool for gaining insight, Gemini. In the past, some rulers believed that their dreams held great insights and they employed people to interpret them. Whether you think dreams are mystical insights or random brainwaves, there is much to be gained. Recurring dreams hold significance. They can point to something that you need to take care of. Consider exploring this area.
 ----- 
 Follow your instincts, Cancer. Even if you have a tendency to listen more to reason, put it aside today. While your ears hear words, your intuition can hear what's between the words and unsaid, providing you with a bigger picture than whatever is presented. If everything sounds right but feels wrong, you'd be better off trusting your feelings. Act with careful consideration and caution.
 ----- 
 Feed your mind new knowledge, Leo. Visit a bookstore or read some interesting information on the web. If you have more time, visit the library or find out about some courses that might be perfect for you. There's knowledge to be had everywhere you look, provided you're open to receiving it. People are often the best resource. Ask someone to explain something, if that's what you need.
 ----- 
 Try to see nightmares as safe ways to understand feelings, Virgo. No one likes to experience them, and we'd sooner forget them once awake, but the best way to ensure they don't return is to understand them. What's frightening you? Why do you feel insecure? Consider these questions and look for answers. Fear, pain, and anxiety are the most common ingredients of a real cold
 ----- 
 Are you living your dreams, Libra? Are you still in touch with them? The energy from today's planetary aspects can lend strength and encouragement to this part of your life. Seize the opportunity to take hold of the things that you want most of all. Ask yourself what you want people to say about you after you're gone. Get back on track to a fulfilled life by taking steps toward your desires.
 ----- 
 Check out advancing your career or education today, Scorpio. The energy can favor expansion and growth. When was the last time you learned a new skill? It doesn't have to be work related. If flower arranging, skydiving, or massage therapy is something that appeals to you, go for it. Never stop looking for ways to expand your knowledge.
 ----- 
 Do you recognize your intuition as a valuable asset, Sagittarius? Some people do and some don't. Which group are you in? It's easier to trust in concrete, factual reality than in things you can't see or touch. But your intuition can serve you more than you may realize. That gut feeling you experience can guide you with caution and alert you to danger. Put more trust in it and see.
 ----- 
 Use your creativity to make things happen today, Capricorn. Remember that creativity doesn't always take the form of a finished product. Use it to come up with innovative ways to approach a task, project, or problem. Trust in your ability to discover such possibilities. You're an intelligent and creative person. Combine the two to make an unbeatable tool for finding solutions to almost anything.
 ----- 
 Find some new ways to expand your horizons, Aquarius. The web has an infinite amount of information to explore, and your community and local colleges offer many courses from which to choose. Think about what you'd enjoy learning. Perhaps a new skill for your job or a crafts class that shows you how to make things. Whether self
 ----- 
 Step out of your routine, Pisces. Do this every so often to increase your knowledge and expand your horizons. The planetary aspects favor this. Walking to a different beat can give you far more than you imagine. Try something you've never considered before. Go to a new place. Change your desk around to gain a new perspective. See what you can discover about yourself and the world.
 ----- 
 This is an excellent day to express your natural creativity, Aries. The arts will likely be very important to you. You may find that nothing brings you more pleasure on days like this. Consider putting this to good use by painting, sculpting, doing crafts, or whatever you like. You will find that engaging in creative activities with a focus on giving may be the perfect thing for you.
 ----- 
 If you're feeling tired, Taurus, you may need to lie back, close your eyes, and listen to some soothing music. You work hard most of the time, so it can do your body and mind good to just relax and listen to your favorite music. Why not do this today? Even a few minutes will make a difference. You can always use the quiet time to plan if you have to feel you've accomplished something.
 ----- 
 Today may bring up strong feelings, Gemini. This may not be new, as you have a tendency to feel things deeply. But it may be a bit tough to find a way to express this. While you're creative, finding the right activity to get you going isn't always easy. Why not visit a bookstore and look for some appealing craft books or art materials? This might spark ideas for new ways to express yourself.
 ----- 
 Today, Cancer, consider that artistic expression can happen in many ways. It isn't always about drawing a picture, singing a song, playing music, or acting. The way that you arrange your home or workspace is an artistic expression. So are how you dress and do your hair. Each thing you do is an expression of you and your choice of style. Being uniquely artistic is innate for you.
 ----- 
 You may find that today brings great physical strength and energy to you, Leo. Given this, you may really want to do some tough, challenging physical work. This is certainly the day for it, so why not go for it? Do some yard work or clean out closets, cupboards, drawers, and filing cabinets. Consider donating items that you don't use anymore or plan a garage sale to make some bucks.
 ----- 
 Virgo, it's prime time to get busy. Activities that require focus or creativity will be supported. Physical strength and energy will encourage you to do something active. If you've felt sluggish, tired, or a little under the weather, today's planetary aspect can put an end to that. Consider artistic projects that take strength, such as building something out of wood.
 ----- 
 Your active side may show through today, Libra. While you can be extremely focused on brainwork, you also love to keep active and do physical work. When you have a project like cleaning your home, you can be very fast and efficient when you want to. This is a good day to get a lot accomplished. Run around doing this and that. You will probably enjoy it very much and feel very satisfied afterward.
 ----- 
 If you've been feeling tired or sick lately, this will probably turn around for you, Scorpio. You may often experience moodiness, and this can be a real drain. Your emotional state can affect how your body feels. Be sure to take care of your feelings as well as your body. If there are things that need to be worked out, take care of them today. The two really do go together.
 ----- 
 You will probably be very busy today, Sagittarius, which may suit you just fine. This can work in your favor if you have some work to catch up on. Being active and getting things done will be natural for you. In fact, when you have to sit for too long, you probably feel restless or anxious. You fidget and squirm. If you find yourself doing this, go do something more active!
 ----- 
 Today, Capricorn, your ability to stand up for your decisions and not let others sway you may be enhanced. This will be especially true if you've arrived at a resolution that solves a problem. Others may often try to change your decisions. Maybe this is because they succeed, but not today. The planetary aspects are working in your favor, and you will feel a new strength. Follow your own heart.
 ----- 
 You may feel a real need to get moving today, Aquarius. Almost everyone prefers quiet activities, books, art, and even just sitting around to physical activity at times. But your health can suffer if you aren't active, Fresh air, exercise, and sunshine are vital to your well
 ----- 
 Today, Pisces, you will probably have a ton of energy at your disposal for getting into all kinds of activities. Finish any work that still needs to be completed. Do some cleaning and organizing or see about getting out for a little warm weather fun. Whatever you choose, try to make sure it's active. You will need a place for all that energy to go. Quiet sedentary pursuits won't do it for you.
 ----- 
 If you feel cautious today, Aries, don't be alarmed. This can be a good thing, Aries, as you can be too trusting at times or forget to take care when going into something new. Use a little caution in everything you do to keep safe. This is true with relationships, too. Give a little more thought and time to things to help you choose more wisely.
 ----- 
 Taurus, personal dignity may be important to you today. This may come about when things go wrong or if you're accused of something you didn't do. You always have control over your dignity. Your daily actions affirm this. The key is to hold on tightly to who you are and what you believe in. Defend your dignity if it's challenged. It's one thing that no one can take from you no matter what.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if someone describes you as conservative, Gemini. It may be true. It could indicate that it's important for you to maintain control over most things 
 ----- 
 Your mother may be on your mind today, Cancer. Your mother probably affects how you think, act, and feel, both in the past and now. If your mother's sign is opposite yours, conflict and misunderstanding can happen more easily. Take the time to learn about her sign today to help you understand her and the relationship you have.
 ----- 
 Focus on yourself today, Leo. Take note of your health. You probably know that this is something you must take care of always, not just sometimes. Daily routines are important. It's up to you to stick to them. The little things like taking vitamins, staying active, and relaxing help maintain a healthy body. If you aren't feeling your best, make your habits more conducive to glowing health.
 ----- 
 No dream is too big or too late to fulfill. You may be thinking about your special dreams today, Virgo. Perhaps you aspire to do something really great, be a pioneer in some field, or be a prominent figure. Whatever it is can happen if you believe in yourself and work toward it. Don't let naysayers stop you. If you decide you can, you probably will.
 ----- 
 Chances are good that you will receive a helping hand or comfort from someone many years your senior who cares about you, Libra. Don't hesitate to ask for their thoughts, ideas, and assistance. They will probably enjoy being able to do this for you and be glad that you've approached them. Be open and accept the love and support that's offered.
 ----- 
 Today, Scorpio, you may think about competition and possible future goals. Imagining and dreaming can serve you well. What did you dream about as a kid? Who did you want to become? Are you close to this in your life now? If not, is this all right for you? Take time to think such things through and, if need be, get back on the right track.
 ----- 
 You may think about your finances today, Sagittarius. It's never too late to learn about saving and investing, especially if there's something you really want to do, like travel. Preparing for retirement can seem surreal when you're young, but it's important to start early. Regardless of how your affairs have gone to date, change starts now. Write down your goals and meet with your financial adviser.
 ----- 
 Take the time today to consider your health, Capricorn. Do you get enough rest, eat the right foods, take vitamins, exercise every day, go to the doctor when you need to, and take time to relax? All these help you have a lifetime of good health. Living a long, healthy life is something we all want. Start now to take care of your body.
 ----- 
 Today you may emphasize organizing things and managing your life, Aquarius. Take a look at your time management. It's possible to plan every day so you have enough time to do what you have to get done as well as do everything you'd like to do. Set priorities to keep things flowing well. There are many books and websites out there on this subject. Check them out.
 ----- 
 One day, I want to be. When you were little, how did you finish that sentence, Pisces? See what your memory and imagination come up with. Is your life what you dreamed it would be? If not, consider what you could do to change it. Maybe you should lie on your back and gaze at the clouds or stars. This childlike activity may spark some ideas for you.
 ----- 
 You might have to make a choice between telling the truth and lying today, Aries. In some circumstances, this can be difficult, especially if you're afraid you will hurt someone's feelings. Keep in mind that a lie can take more energy than the truth. Consider what you would want the other person to do in your place. Stick to your morals and ethics even if it's tough.
 ----- 
 You're known to be kindhearted. However, being taken advantage of can happen as a result. It's important for you to trust your instincts to prevent this from happening. If what you hear doesn't match your feelings, trust your feelings. If you think you're being used, try to move past it. It would be a real shame if resentment permanently squelched your giving nature.
 ----- 
 Your nature is intense, Gemini. You probably feel things deeply and spend a lot of time lost in thought. Yet, too much intensity can take a toll on your health and well
 ----- 
 Feed your mind today, Cancer. While you no doubt enjoy being active and social, you get bored fairly quickly, too. You need a constant supply of intriguing, fresh material in order to feel your best. Explore an interesting subject or learn a new hobby. Stimulate your mind and your body will become more energetic. Use the Internet if you can't get away.
 ----- 
 If you think you have to prove that you have something valuable to offer, Leo, consider this carefully. You're naturally friendly and can get along with almost anyone. This may already be your strength. You have something great to bring to a crowd. Consider being yourself and not trying so hard to feel a part of things. Look at your qualities and you will prove your worth to yourself.
 ----- 
 Consider putting your problem
 ----- 
 Libra, don't be fooled by others who aren't straight with you. If you don't know the person well, trust your instincts. You tend to care for others, so it can be easy for you to feel sorry for someone and be inclined to help. Make sure that the person you help really deserves it and is telling you the whole story. Taking this extra time can save you problems later.
 ----- 
 It could be easy to get carried away today, Scorpio. You might get caught up in some excitement or base your decisions on another's word. You need to use your head on a day like this. Double
 ----- 
 The energy that you feel today may have you so jittery that others don't know what to do with you, Sagittarius. The day's influences can bring a boost. You'd be wise to plan things to do to expend it all. Get busy with physical chores at work or home. Pull things out and organize, move furniture around, whatever it takes. It's better to be productive than drive everyone crazy.
 ----- 
 Venturing into something new and different may be what you need, Capricorn. You have a very solid, practical side to your personality, but the need for excitement and adventure is likely to be just as strong. If you've had your nose to the grindstone recently, take some time off for fun. Visit a friend or, better yet, drive to a place you haven't been to and explore.
 ----- 
 You may want to learn about something today, Aquarius. At work and home there's a set schedule of what you must tend to and when. On your own time, you're free to research anything your heart desires. Intellectual growth is something you enjoy, so why not spend time online or in the library finding out more about your favorite things? Whether cooking or genealogy, you will find something new.
 ----- 
 If you happen to meet new people today, Pisces, be careful. Some folks appear interesting because they're bold or dangerous. Perhaps they do things you'd never dream of doing. This may seem interesting, but it can lead to trouble and hurt you if you aren't careful. Stick to your usual standards and ethics. If danger excites you too much, it may be time to reexamine your life and change things.
 ----- 
 Watch out for the green
 ----- 
 You may feel insecure about your appearance today, Taurus. This can be a vicious cycle to get into. The result is almost always negative. Rather than pick yourself apart, consider finding ways to accept your looks. Whether it's your weight or age or anything else, if you can't accept yourself, you will always find something wrong no matter how many changes you make.
 ----- 
 Jealousy might rear its head today, Gemini. The key to it all is to understand where and why you feel insecure. If you're jealous of a mate, what's going on in the relationship? Is trust an issue? If this comes up at work, is it because you don't feel recognized for your contributions? Examine the cause of jealousy. It's almost always a symptom of a deeper problem.
 ----- 
 Arts and crafts may interest you today, Cancer. Even if you lean more toward sports, an artistic streak will likely run pretty strong in you. The process of creating can be richly satisfying, both in the process and in the satisfaction of a finished product. Allow yourself the opportunity to explore this, as the day's energy will lend much to your abilities.
 ----- 
 Getting along with others may prove challenging today, Leo. The influence from the planetary aspects can have you preferring to withdraw and isolate. You might feel impatient and annoyed. If so, and being alone is an option, go for it. If it isn't, you will need to curb the tendency to be argumentative or confrontational. Exercise patience and avoid conflict.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if you're a little weepy today, Virgo. The influence from planets can enhance your sensitivity to almost everything, including your own feelings. Take heart. It's bound to be short
 ----- 
 Fanaticism or obsessive thinking may be something you need to look at today, Libra. Common areas for such behaviors are in the pursuit of money, power, success, and romance. There's a fine line between ambition and obsession. If you find that you think of nothing else but one fixation, it may be time to talk with someone about it. He or she may see what you don't want to see.
 ----- 
 Don't act impulsively today, Scorpio. It could be easy to confuse this with spontaneity. One has more thought put into it than the other. With this day's influence, be certain to look before you leap. Think everything through, from decisions to projects to contracts. Read the fine print more than once. When it comes to relationships, be careful not to trust too quickly.
 ----- 
 Is it time to take a more drastic approach to a problem, Sagittarius? If you've made several attempts to resolve your trouble but to no avail, you might consider it. As long as "drastic" doesn't mean "destructive," you may find success trying something far more forward and insistent. Be careful, however. Think things through carefully first. Run any ideas you have past a trusted friend.
 ----- 
 Tap into your creativity to unblock the emotional flow today, Capricorn. This can be a powerful tool. Creativity is a big part of who you are, almost as big as communication. Your emotions link to these two aspects and constantly interact beneath the surface. If one gets blocked, release it by focusing on the other. Express yourself through creativity and consider talking to someone close.
 ----- 
 You may need to deal with someone's disapproval today, Aquarius. This will likely come from someone you see as either a superior or authority figure, perhaps a parent. While it's important to listen to this person, if what they say involves your job, personal life, or how you choose to live, it's no one's concern but yours. No matter how you do things, someone will disapprove somewhere.
 ----- 
 Time alone is essential for everyone, Pisces, but make sure you recognize when you're isolated to the point where it's unhealthy. If you realize you're alone because you're avoiding something, you might consider your alternatives. Things will only fester under these conditions. Face whatever it is that's upsetting you so you can begin to work things out.
 ----- 
 A project could be successfully completed today, Aries. Discussions may already be taking place about the next one, but you aren't inclined to think about that, at least not right away. You will want to bask in your accomplishment and relax for a while. No one can blame you for that, so don't worry if you don't go to brainstorming sessions. Wait until it progresses beyond talk.
 ----- 
 If you're involved in the study of a particular subject, Taurus, today you might want to bury yourself in your books and learn as much as you can. This is good, because your concentration is especially good. Go to the library or a private room where you won't be distracted and hit the books. Find some new works on the subject if you can. You might discover some surprising information.
 ----- 
 This isn't the day to make investments, Gemini. You may read in the paper or online about some hot new stocks, but be very careful. If you're interested, consult a professional before investing money. Even after you've talked to an expert, it's still a good idea to wait a day or two before you make the investment. Any hot tips you receive today could be rather doubtful. Be patient.
 ----- 
 Does a love partner appear to be moody today, Cancer? One moment your friend may be enthusiastic and optimistic about the future, and the next moment overcome with gloom. Don't let this get to you, and certainly don't get overly upset with your partner. Listen rather than talk, and be patient. Tomorrow your friend's moods should be back to normal.
 ----- 
 Are you working two jobs, Leo? Today one could demand a lot of you, probably at the expense of the other. You tend to be very conscientious and responsible, so this might bother you, but don't let it get to you. The day may come when the situation is reversed. Everyone around you knows that you're an asset to the enterprise, even if there are times like this when you have to ask for a break.
 ----- 
 Your natural urge to innovate may seem to have vanished today, Virgo. You may not feel like doing anything outside of routine tasks that you can do automatically. You're suffering from low biorhythms, so don't fall into the trap of thinking you're turning into a lazy bum. Relax today, and tomorrow you will be your usual energetic, inventive self. Tonight, watch some videos and forget your day.
 ----- 
 The urge to stay in and rearrange your furniture might hit you today, Libra. You may want to clean out the shelves in your kitchen, add some new knickknacks, or rearrange your books into specific classifications. This may be a lot of work, but it will also be a lot of fun. Get other members of the household to help and turn it into a party.
 ----- 
 Are you expecting an important communication, perhaps business related, Scorpio? If it comes today, it will probably come late. If you feel you must sit around and wait for it, find something else to do in the meantime or you will drive yourself crazy. If it doesn't arrive by the end of the day, resign yourself to waiting. Don't panic. It will come soon enough.
 ----- 
 A check you've been expecting to receive by mail will probably be delayed, Sagittarius. It's nothing to worry about. Chances are it got hung up at the post office and will arrive soon. Don't waste your time worrying needlessly. If you feel it necessary, make contingency plans for getting by. Your money is coming. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 You may not be your usual cheery self today, Capricorn. Gloom may have come over you. You may doubt everything that happens in your life. No matter how promising a career, romance, or money matter seems, you think the worst. Treat yourself today. Get a massage, relax in a hot tub, and rub and soak out those doubting spirits. That will get you through the day. Tomorrow you will be back to normal.
 ----- 
 Happy memories of a beloved grandparent may float to the surface today, Aquarius, and you may wonder why. Something or someone you've encountered in the past few days may have reminded you of this person. It's nice and it isn't an accident. What personality trait of yours does your grandparent call to mind? A psycho
 ----- 
 A meeting may take place today that you don't want to attend, Pisces. It could be long and boring, but you should still make the effort to listen. Colleagues will want to discuss the issues with you afterward, and you might learn something in spite of the boredom. Think of it this way 
 ----- 
 Romance blossoms for you today, Aries, and commitment or marriage may be just over the horizon. You and your beloved may have recently reached a new understanding that has bonded you more tightly. Don't feel silly if you spend the day together walking around in a romantic haze. That's perfectly acceptable 
 ----- 
 Service to others might take up a large part of your day, Taurus, perhaps on an artistic level or maybe in the form of sharing psychic or healing energy. Don't think your efforts are unappreciated. Those you're helping may be reticent about saying anything, but your efforts aren't lost on them. Think of it like a bank. Your friends will be there for you when you need them.
 ----- 
 The words for today are "romance" and "creativity," Gemini. Romance is enhanced by passion generated by a gratifying love relationship that will probably last for a long time. This same relationship, and its emotions could give rise to artistic inspiration that can produce works of a quality that surprises even you. Don't exhaust yourself. Know when to stop.
 ----- 
 Has a new housemate recently moved in, Cancer? If so, you can expect this person to live with you for a while. This is good, because he or she is likely to be very loving, supportive, and able to bear his or her share of the household responsibilities. You and this person, along with any others who live with you, could become very close and possibly even friends for life.
 ----- 
 A love letter or perhaps a poem or other artistic work dedicated to you could make your day, Leo. A warm feeling of being cherished and adored could stay with you throughout the day as a result. Hang on to this rosy glow when things get rocky, especially on the job. The feelings expressed in this communication will probably last for a long time, so be prepared.
 ----- 
 A love relationship that's been around for a long time could be enhanced today by an increased level of sensuality, Virgo. Intense emotion could pervade your being, making it difficult to concentrate on much else. You will probably spend the day looking forward to when you can be alone with your beloved. The passion that pervades your lovemaking now is worthy of a romance novel.
 ----- 
 Artistic activities or those involving healing are enhanced today, Libra. Whatever you try is going to be more a part of your very being than it would be at other times. Love, art, psychic or spiritual activities 
 ----- 
 Love takes on an idealized and fairytale aura today, Scorpio, as you and a current or potential partner spend time alone, talking or just enjoying being together. The warmth, affection, and high regard you have for each other are apparent to everyone. The nice thing about it is that these feelings are likely to last. Look forward to many such days.
 ----- 
 A meditation circle or other group activity devoted to spiritual pursuits could be on your agenda today, Sagittarius. It's important that you attend, as you need a little peace and quiet, as well as the support from others in the group. The affection you all feel for one another permeates the evening. Bask in it and write down any revelations that come to you.
 ----- 
 Career and financial successes might finally come your way after months and perhaps years of striving, Capricorn. The emotional support you receive from those who've been working with you can be very gratifying, and it's likely to last for a long time. If you like what you're doing, chances are you will be doing it for a while. If you're committed to your profession, keep up the good work.

 A complex creative project could require some in

You can accomplish quite a bit using this astral energy, so hop to it.
 ----- 
 Someone or something may spur you on today, Taurus. You may feel a nagging impulse to get up and do something. Follow that instinct and stop moaning about staying in bed.

Realize what you need to do to keep it running smoothly.
 ----- 
 Bite the bullet and get it done, Gemini. Finish the projects and get the lingering odds and ends out of your way.

 ----- 
 Today might not be as lighthearted and free
 ----- 
 Today is a fantastic day for you, Leo. Things are naturally flowing your way. You can accomplish a great deal. There are few hurdles in your way, perhaps none. You're well disciplined about your time and what's needed to get the job done and how to meet your goals. Your emotions are especially calm and stable, giving you the opportunity to observe and evaluate them from a neutral viewpoint.
 ----- 
 There's a conservative air today that doesn't fit well with your erratic, unconventional nature, Virgo. Things might pop up to remind you that you should be a bit more disciplined in your approach. Your thoughts and emotions are perhaps a bit less controlled than usual, so take this time to become centered and evaluate the truth. Today is a good day to focus.
 ----- 
 Something is tugging you back down to reality, Libra. Your mind has tended to be in the clouds lately, but now you need to ground your emotions and realize that you operate on a physical plane, too. Your emotions are stable for now, affording you a chance to step back and evaluate how you've been treating yourself. Make sure you give yourself the attention you deserve.
 ----- 
 There's a conservative veil over your emotions, Scorpio. Issues from the past might arise and rub you the wrong way. You move onward and upward by nature, plowing ahead without thinking of the consequences. Today you might be a bit more sober than usual. Look at what's worked in the past in terms of keeping your fiery emotions intact. Try not to resent the past but learn from it.
 ----- 
 Today is fantastic for tuning in to your inner self, Sagittarius. You will have a level, grounded mind from which to make conscious evaluations of your emotional state.

Use this grounded energy to get things done.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit weighed down today, Capricorn, and perhaps more reserved than usual. Someone may be raining on your parade, but don't let it get you down. Use the grounded energy of the day to get things done. You have your hands full with many tasks, so sit down and bring them to completion. Calm your nervous system and balance your frantic emotions. Ease off the caffeine.
 ----- 
 Today's a good day to ground your fluctuating emotions, Aquarius. Step back from the drama you create and evaluate your inner state.

 ----- 
 Things may be calm today, Pisces. You might not be your boisterous self, but that could be a good thing. Use the sobering energy to evaluate your emotions and honestly look at your relationships. Are you getting the respect you deserve? Perhaps you need to tell some people that their words or actions aren't OK. Meanwhile, get things done. Take care of errands and check items off your list.
 ----- 
 Today a deep concern for others' feelings could have you lending a sympathetic ear to those in need of some understanding. It's more important to listen than talk, Aries, even though your practicality might want to express itself. Your affairs should go smoothly, bringing you and those around you a lot of satisfaction. Don't be surprised if you shed a few tears of joy at some point.
 ----- 
 Today you might complete a project that was difficult but important to your career. Acknowledgement of your dedication and hard work could find you more emotionally overwhelmed than makes you comfortable. You may have to make a special effort to control your feelings. You've moved mountains to get where you are and it's nice to be recognized. In the evening, celebrate. You deserve it.
 ----- 
 A long
 ----- 
 An intense, emotional dream could move you so powerfully that you wake with the odd sense that the dream was real. Write it down, Cancer. Maybe it is. Efforts to overcome obstacles and advance yourself in your career could finally be paying off. You might be walking around in a daze asking if it's really happened. It has. Make the most of it. And don't be afraid to reveal your feelings to others.
 ----- 
 Emotional talks with your partner could move you to tears, Leo. If there have been difficulties in your relationship, you've overcome them and probably reached a new understanding. Any romantic relationship or friendship started or moved forward now shows lasting promise. Your inclination may be to control your feelings, but don't be afraid to show them. It's OK in situations like this.
 ----- 
 Today you may feel the need to do a lot of work around the house, Virgo. Perhaps you expect visitors or you simply want to get the place spruced up for your own enjoyment. You need to take it easy and not try to do everything at once. You could run into difficulties that require help from others who may be out. Pace yourself and control the urge to run through your chores like a steamroller.
 ----- 
 Some intense, revealing communications with a close friend or lover could reveal wonderful new things about your relationship. Perhaps you have more in common than you thought. Perhaps fears prove groundless. As a result, Libra, the two of you could grow closer and discover a new mutual sense of purpose. Enjoy the positive feelings, and have a great day together.
 ----- 
 Ancient social traditions could be a powerful part of your day, Scorpio. An emotional event concerning your family 
 ----- 
 You usually place a lot of importance on self
 ----- 
 Expect some great news regarding money, possibly involving professional advancement. You may have to control the urge to cry tears of joy, Capricorn. In a different vein, a close friend could be going through some changes and might want your support. Your best course of action would be to listen rather than give advice. You may have to control yourself if the situation defies all reason.
 ----- 
 Happy events involving your mother or another close female relative might have you feeling emotional, Aquarius. It could involve a marriage or birth. Your own projects, particularly those done with other people, could be going well in spite of having to overcome some difficulties. The results could move you to tears, and you may feel the need to control yourself. Don't be afraid to show how you feel.
 ----- 
 Your intuitive abilities are at an all
 ----- 
 Changes in your home could cause temporary frustration that creates some tension with family members. Perhaps you're moving, cleaning, or refurnishing, and everyone is getting in everyone else's way. The best way to handle this situation is to try to get the job done as quickly as possible. Once it's done, Aries, tempers will subside and all will be fine.
 ----- 
 Miscommunication with someone far away could lead to bruised egos, heightened emotions, and angry phone calls. Don't get sucked into a quarrel, Taurus. Try to sort out the problem. Changes in your neighborhood could cause trouble getting around, so be prepared for blocked streets and heavy traffic. Walk, if you can. It will clear your head and get you where you're going more quickly.
 ----- 
 Your psychoanalytical talents could be put to work today when misunderstandings come up. Your friends aren't likely to be thinking clearly and may not respond to reassurances, Gemini. Use your intuition to determine the best way to defuse the situation. Finances might cause some worry now, but your ingenuity and fiscal sense should put things right. Go out and have a good time tonight.
 ----- 
 A person you're attracted to may seem to be interested in someone else. This could bring up your insecurities and jealousy. Don't make yourself crazy, Cancer. Try to learn the facts before letting the situation get the better of you. Invitations to more than one social event for the same night might force you to make an uncomfortable choice. Make the choice that's best for you.
 ----- 
 Someone is keeping secrets from you. We all have private issues we don't wish to share, Leo, but this affects you. Your intuition will probably tell you who this person is. Try to get him or her to open up without exerting pressure. Unfinished tasks could be driving you crazy. You may try to run through them quickly, causing too much stress. Get the most crucial done and let the others go.
 ----- 
 Perhaps you planned to attend a group event but circumstances beyond your control got in the way. Maybe it was canceled. This could cause some disappointment for you and others, Virgo. Find something else to do. A project of your own is likely to need some attention, and this challenge could keep you engrossed for hours. Tonight, treat yourself to dinner out.
 ----- 
 A visitor who needs a little sympathy could visit you today. Your friend probably wants some advice about some problems. He or she could also bring information involving new scientific or metaphysical studies that you find fascinating. This information could trigger your own insights. Write down your ideas. You will want to remember them.
 ----- 
 Some important plans, perhaps for a vacation or involving education in some way, could be temporarily blocked by circumstances beyond your control, Scorpio. This can cause considerable upset and might even set your temper on edge. You may be tempted to take your frustrations out on others. It would be far more productive to find ways to make your plans work, even if there's a delay. Go to it.
 ----- 
 A letter or phone call could bring upsetting news about money, Sagittarius. Your first reaction may be to blame yourself or someone else, but the circumstances are probably beyond anyone's control. Chances are good that it can be set right. Before anyone gets too upset, it's best to investigate and find out what needs to be done. It may take some effort, but all will be well.
 ----- 
 Jealousy could rear its ugly head today, Capricorn. This may involve a romantic relationship. Jealousy is often groundless. If you want to avoid an upset, try a little communicating. This is definitely the time to make the effort to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Strong emotions can work for you under some circumstances. A passionate reconciliation is better than an angry estrangement.
 ----- 
 Nervous tension could cause a temporary malaise that keeps your energy low today. Tasks and chores need to be done, Aquarius, so you will probably drag yourself up and try to finish them in spite of the way you feel. Try not to get overworked, and try not to take your weariness out on others. It's better to let work go than make yourself and everyone else more stressed out.
 ----- 
 A group with which you're affiliated may be temporarily torn apart by politics and quarrels. If so, Pisces, it's best to stay out of it. A friend could be having trouble and come to you for advice and help. Don't get too frustrated by his or her weaknesses. This could be a frustrating day for you 
 ----- 
 Some rather depressing information could come to you today from far away, Aries. This is less likely to be about your immediate situation or circle of friends than it is about something social or political in nature. It's probably the subject of a lot of talk around you. You might need to run some errands in your community, but for some reason you can't. Relax. Tomorrow should be fine.
 ----- 
 You've been working hard to improve your financial situation, Taurus. You might be on the verge of attaining what you want, but temporary obstacles could get in your way. You could be in a bit of a panic, wondering if this means you will never get where you want to be. Don't worry. That isn't the case. You just need to assess the situation and figure out what to do to get over this hurdle.
 ----- 
 A partner might be feeling rather down and need you to cheer him or her up, Gemini. Too many social invitations could come your way today. You may have to turn one of them down. You may not be in the mood for socializing and need to be alone to organize your thoughts. One of the events could be business related and you may feel obligated to go. Put in an appearance. Don't feel compelled to stay long.
 ----- 
 Today you might enjoy planning to have some visitors stay with you for a while, Cancer. Worry about developments on the job or unfinished chores of your own might have you feeling a bit stressed and under the weather. You need to look at your situation objectively.

 ----- 
 A friend could be depressed and need your advice, Leo. Some long
 ----- 
 Some professional colleagues might be coming to visit, Virgo, and you may not be looking forward to it. You could be worried. How will it go? Will you make a good impression?

All is going to go very well.
 ----- 
 Today you might need to run some errands, Libra, but they might prove difficult for a number of reasons. The errands could be personal or business related. Communication may be temporarily blocked. Messages may not be delivered or you could be playing phone tag. On days like this, you need to make a special effort to keep cool. Nothing is so important that you have to drive yourself crazy.
 ----- 
 You might reflect on recent successes in business and money and suddenly feel a strong sense of gloom, wondering if it's going to continue. Don't panic, Scorpio. It isn't a vision of the future. It's only a temporary feeling. Work it off through exercise or throw yourself into a task. Meditation could also help. Get the endorphins going and your optimism and enthusiasm should return.
 ----- 
 Work that could advance you professionally could take you away from loved ones, Sagittarius, and cause some emotional tension. You might feel down because you'd rather be with your loved ones but feel it's important to move ahead now. Try to make up for it with some quality time. It's crucial to make the most of the current planetary positions. Everyone will be glad when you see results.
 ----- 
 A task, perhaps job related or perhaps one of your own, might prove weightier than you expected. You're working too hard and you could be feeling tired and dejected, Capricorn. Exactly how crucial is it to get this done right now? If it isn't vital, get as much done as you can without compromising your well
 ----- 
 Someone, perhaps a person involved with a group you're in, may ask you to help in some way today. You probably don't want to do it, Aquarius, possibly because you have plans. Don't be afraid to say no. Your creative energy should be high and your imagination working overtime, but other responsibilities interfere with your doing anything about it now. Note your ideas and come back to them later.
 ----- 
 Career developments could look promising now, Pisces, and you might be in a hurry to finish whatever needs to be done. But responsibilities to home and family might interfere. For some reason, you might have to stay home. Perhaps you experienced some intense dreams that you feel are significant but you can't remember them. If you stop trying to remember, they may come back to you.
 ----- 
 A romantic evening at home with your partner could bring you two closer together, Aries. Your emotions are intense right now, however, so you need to use your intuition to judge exactly how much of your feelings you should reveal. An intellectual passion could also come your way. You might discover a new field of interest, and you will want to study it at home for hours.
 ----- 
 Information received from far away could compel you to learn more about the subject, Taurus. You might be inspired to use your new knowledge in a project that includes a partner. Your mind is insightful now. If you face decisions, this is definitely the day to follow your heart. Don't be surprised if you also find your telepathic abilities expanded.
 ----- 
 Money matters may be advanced through using your intuition and inner power today, Gemini. You might have a hunch that your idea for making extra money might just work. Look into it at least. Don't let anyone talk you out of it until you know the facts. You might also rediscover a long
 ----- 
 A surge of inner power could make you feel like you can move mountains, Cancer. If you've been contemplating actions that others believe impossible, this is the day to get them going. Career matters, romance, and creative projects could all be advanced today by careful effort on your part. Give it some thought, write down your ideas, consider all contingencies, and move ahead.
 ----- 
 Memories from your distant past could resurface today, Leo. You may wonder why you're suddenly thinking about them, but they probably represent a release of old emotional hang
 ----- 
 Today represents a new beginning in many ways. An old friend could reappear in your life and bring up memories that are both pleasant and disconcerting, Virgo. Don't worry too much about this. It probably represents a needed release. You may also get involved with a group that has goals you embrace. New friends could also come your way. Expect a few surprises from all sides today.
 ----- 
 Emotions could be running high, Libra. Someone in your entourage may have a problem with an authority figure and political issues could come up. You're likely to feel especially powerful now, and so you might be tempted to throw your hat in the ring. It's better to stay out of anything political and channel that power and passion into your own project. That's likelier to bring positive results.
 ----- 
 Heightened mental powers might make you spend a lot of time reading or doing research of some kind, Scorpio. Your curiosity is especially sharp right now. You might even consider advancing your education somehow, especially since new interests have been popping up for some time. New friends in fascinating fields might also have started you thinking. This is a good time to look into this.
 ----- 
 Sagittarius, your intuition might increase today to the point where you feel like you could deduce the thoughts and motives of people you've never met before. Reading the news might bring you sudden insights as to how things are going to turn out. You could decide to put this ability to work to advance your financial condition. Do this if you can 
 ----- 
 You should be feeling especially passionate now, Capricorn, especially regarding partnerships. Romantic partnerships definitely call for an evening alone together. Professional and creative ones, on the other hand, call for a new project that you both believe in. Look to events in distant states or foreign countries for inspiration. Something begun far away from home could capture your imagination.
 ----- 
 If you haven't been feeling like yourself lately, Aquarius, a surge of inner power could push you over the top and make you feel strong and healthy again. You could decide to complete all your unfinished tasks today. You could get most of them done by day's end. Don't forget to take time out to enjoy yourself. You want to make the most of your newfound strength.
 ----- 
 A surge of passion could dominate your day unless you find an outlet for it, Pisces. Romantic passion is high, so an intimate evening with a lover is a good idea. Creative passion is strong. You could have a sudden inspiration, perhaps influenced by a distant place. Don't be afraid to take time from your mundane chores to pursue this inspiration. Creativity is as important as anything else.
 ----- 
 The bizarre nature of the day may leave you feeling a bit bewildered, Aries. Don't sweat it. Focus on your romantic nature and incredibly nurturing heart. Use your instinctive healing abilities to care for a close friend in need. Today is an especially good day to connect with others and openly share your feelings. Confide in people you trust. Consider calling your mom.
 ----- 
 You will be in an especially affectionate and loving mood today, Taurus. Your romantic nature is heightened and your nurturing qualities are strong. You're extra sensitive and receptive. You might find that you have no problem communicating your truest feelings to others. Connect with those you feel especially close to, and enjoy an intimate evening.
 ----- 
 Annoyances of daily life may rub you the wrong way today, Gemini. Other people's strong opinions and odd quirks may be difficult to swallow and your fuse may be a bit shorter than usual. Emotions could also run high, and you may do battle with the feelings in your own heart. Perhaps someone you care about deeply is creating unnecessary friction in your relationship.
 ----- 
 Be open and honest about your feelings toward others today, Cancer. Your receptive nature should be ready. Take a break and let others come to you. Unexpected events may pop out of nowhere. Opportunities for new growth in love and romance are definitely at your fingertips as long as you're ready to receive them. Don't try to force the issue if the time and place aren't right. Let it flow.
 ----- 
 Your heart beats extra strong today, Leo, but it may not seem like anyone knows it but you. You may feel like you aren't really fitting in with the energy of the day. Don't get down on yourself for it. Realize that not everything is going to go according to your plans. Let things come to you. The unexpected is bound to happen, so don't try to resist the impending change.
 ----- 
 This is a fantastic day for you, Virgo. Join close friends and share a night on the town and fine meal. This is a chance to begin a new cycle of romance. Reflect on past relationship problems, examine their causes, and toss them away so you can invite in a new, uplifting energy for the next cycle of romance. Start a new relationship or strengthen the one you're in.
 ----- 
 Your warm, sensitive nature is perfectly suited to today's aspects, Libra. Your emotional energy is strongly tied to your heart, and you will find that there's a longing to be close to others.

Your creativity is especially piqued today, so start an art project or write a song that inspires or perhaps changes the world.
 ----- 
 You will enjoy a great deal of affection from others today, Scorpio. You radiate an air of love and beauty. Love will come in strong, erratic bursts and you should be on the alert to expect the unexpected. New people will pop out of the woodwork to share their feelings. All group activities are favored, and you're sure to be the life of any party.
 ----- 
 Your heart may be especially sensitive today, Sagittarius. You may feel a bit vulnerable. Your romantic nature is particularly strong, so treat yourself to a pampered evening, including a good meal with someone you love. All relationships with women will go smoothly now. You might want to give your mother a call if you haven't spoken with her in a while. She would love to hear from you.
 ----- 
 All aspects of love and romance will go especially well today, Capricorn. You might take this opportunity to make a bold move toward the object of your affection.

Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 Your connection with others is especially strong today, Aquarius. You will enjoy an important nurturing role. Reconnect with your mother and let her know how you're feeling. Curl up with loved ones tonight and surprise someone with a romantic gesture. Try something unconventional. Your feelings may be strong and erratic. You may be feel like pulling back into your protective shell. If so, do it.
 ----- 
 You might feel especially playful today, Pisces. You can expect to feel a great deal of love and affection from others. Be aware that you will have a strong tendency to indulge in food and drink, so try to keep things in moderation. You may have an aversion to work and lack self
 ----- 
 A phone call may come from someone you know is prone to gossip, Aries. This person may have a lot to say, but be sure you take it with a grain of salt, if not the whole shaker. Your skepticism could prove invaluable in this respect. If what this person says is important, check out the facts before passing it on or taking any action. Chances are it's exaggerated or completely false.
 ----- 
 The desire to make a major purchase of some kind, perhaps a luxury item, might have you counting your pennies today, Taurus. Once they're all counted, you might doubt the wisdom of buying it now. This isn't the day to make a decision either way. Wait a few days and you should see things more clearly and have a better grasp of the situation.
 ----- 
 Worries about a household member could plague you today, Gemini. This person might have gone away without telling anyone, or seem upset. Your friend is probably OK but at odds with someone outside the household rather than in it. Let this person work it out in whatever way they see fit. Your companion will share with you when the time is right.
 ----- 
 A sibling or neighbor may tell you one thing, Cancer, while your intuition tells you the opposite. This isn't a vindictive deception. The person is probably trying to spare your feelings. Perhaps it's better not to challenge this person. Wait until you know more before bringing up the subject. You don't want to cause a rift between the two of you.
 ----- 
 A friend who's having money problems might dump all their woes on you today, Leo. Your inclination isn't to be very sympathetic, but hold back that tendency. The situation is real, and your friend is very worried and needs solutions more than criticism or sympathy. Your common sense and practical nature could be invaluable right now. Offer to listen.
 ----- 
 Have you been given a task to do at work that hasn't been explained properly, Virgo? If so, you may feel at a loss. What to do? It's best to go back to the person who assigned the work and ask for more details. This could be temporarily humbling, but remember, it's better to ask a stupid question than to make a stupid mistake. Don't move ahead until you know exactly what you need to do.
 ----- 
 You're probably excited about a forthcoming journey, Libra, but you may be unclear about the arrangements. Don't let this situation persist or your trip might not work out the way you hope. Get in touch with people who know what's what and get as much information as you can. Then you will know it all before you get on that plane.
 ----- 
 A dream or insight might find you questioning one of your long
 ----- 
 Someone at work may be upset, Sagittarius, and not inclined to communicate their feelings to anyone else. This might cast a pall over the atmosphere. You may wonder if this person is upset with you, but chances are it has a lot more to do with the job than you. Make use of your ability to concentrate, and don't let this get in your way. It isn't worth the trouble.
 ----- 
 Some unsettling news from far away could have you stressed out, Capricorn. This might affect your work if you aren't careful. Your mind may stray back and forth from work to the news and its implications. Stay focused. All signs are that whatever you've heard is likely to be far less troublesome than it appears right now. Don't fly off the handle until you know the facts.
 ----- 
 You're likely to be in a good space right now, Aquarius. If you're single, you're in no hurry to change that. If you're involved, you and your partner should be getting along very well. However, you might experience a little doubt when a current or potential partner becomes uncommunicative. Your friend probably has money worries. Let him or her know you're there to listen, then back off.
 ----- 
 A visitor may come over today, Pisces, but you might wonder why this person bothered. He or she may seem distracted and more inclined to listen to what you say than offer any conversation. Chances are that your friend felt lonely and needed some company. Be flattered. Don't be afraid to launch into a monologue about something you find fascinating. It may be just what your friend needs.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit protective today, Aries, and with good reason. Others are likely to be aggressive when it comes to moving in on your territory. Be strong. Assure yourself as well as those in your charge that everything will be fine. Take reasonable precautions, but don't completely close yourself off to the outside world. That knock at the gate could just as easily provide much
 ----- 
 You may be a bit confused today, Taurus. More than likely, it will be hard for you to get an accurate read on your emotions. One of your automatic responses in situations like this is to turn to a close partner for advice. Unfortunately, this advice may throw you into even more of a tailspin. What you need more than anything is to spend quality time alone.
 ----- 
 Secure your emotions and make sure you're set in your mind before you take action today, Gemini. This is a terrific time to get things started. Following through to completion shouldn't be a problem. The difficult part is taking that first step. This can be easily done on a day like today, so don't miss this opportunity when your intuitive sense is extra keen.
 ----- 
 Break through the potential moodiness of the day, Cancer. Burst into song while walking down the street. Encourage others to sing back to you, as if your life were an opera. Your creativity is extra strong at this point, so let it shine in unexpected areas of your world. You have the wonderful ability to turn even the most mundane situations into something exciting.
 ----- 
 You may be plagued with restlessness, Leo, to the point that you may not be able to get anything done. If you sense that this is happening to you even in the slightest degree, stop whatever you're doing and take a break. Your work isn't worth the sacrifice of your sanity. Consider going to a spa or call up a friend with a hot tub so you can soak in some warm, relaxing water for a while.
 ----- 
 Be careful of exerting your will too strongly toward someone who really isn't receptive to it, Virgo. Be conscious of other people's feelings. Be gentle when it comes to love and romance. You have a yellow light, which means that it's OK to proceed. Be careful that the other person is receptive to your advances. Don't come across as too aggressive and end up making a fool of yourself.
 ----- 
 Overall, this should be a pretty good day for you, Libra, as long as you don't get overly sensitive about certain things. Your awareness is bound to be extra sharp today, so use this ability to stay alert and open to what's going on around you. Perhaps you're feeling a bit restless when it comes to matters of the heart. This is telling you to stop fidgeting and take action.
 ----- 
 This is one day in which your heart pounds with excitement. For some reason, Scorpio, there's a quiet voice inside warning that you may be getting yourself into a great deal of trouble. An enthusiastic approach toward love may be necessary, but this may not be the best day to act. People are too sensitive and not necessarily that impressed with your potentially abrasive demeanor.
 ----- 
 Be more aggressive when it comes to your intentions in a romantic situation, Sagittarius. It would be a great idea to impress your lover with a delicious home
 ----- 
 It would be a good idea to socialize with others today in a comfortable, open setting. Say what you feel instead of just concentrating on what you think, Capricorn. Be just as good a listener as you expect others to be for you. Join a writing circle or take a painting class. Your creativity is looking for an outlet today, so you might as well share this gift among friends.
 ----- 
 Stick with what comes naturally, Aquarius. If something feels difficult or abrasive, this is a sign that your energy is better used elsewhere. But don't turn away until you're sure that what you're facing is actually a combative force instead of your own skewed sense of reality. You could be overly sensitive about a given situation and thereby making up scenarios that don't even exist.
 ----- 
 Your heart may feel extra loving today, Pisces, which is good, since you will probably need it. There is most likely someone close to you who needs a lift of some sort. You may be like the tow truck that arrives to pull a car out of the ditch. Be careful when you hook up the chains. Don't scratch the bumper or pull too hard all at once!
 ----- 
 Aggressive people may interfere with your plans today, Aries, so don't get too upset if things don't work out the way you want them to. Let this be an exercise in learning how to think and act on your feet. Remember that you can play this game as well as others. Deliver an unexpected surprise right back and see how they deal with it. Perhaps you can learn something.
 ----- 
 It's hard to keep your balance when a big rock suddenly falls on one side of the scale, Taurus. Resolving the matter isn't as hard as you think, because this rock has been dropped there as a gift. Even though it might be shocking at first, there's an important message in this surprise. The tricky part is figuring out what it is.
 ----- 
 Like a team of pickpockets in a crowd, a group may have its eyes on you and secretly scheme to take advantage of your innocence, Gemini. One may work to distract you with something playful and harmless, while the others work behind your back to secretly steal your valuables. Stay aware of yourself and your belongings at all times.
 ----- 
 Opportunity is the name of the game for you, Cancer. Don't turn out the lights before you make sure you've explored all your options today. Inspiration may come in a flash of unexpected thought, so make sure you have a pad and pencil handy. A good idea could be disguised as something insignificant, but if anyone is able to see the potential in something, it's you.
 ----- 
 Today you may be asked to choose between the old and the new, Leo. It's as if people are protesting in some manner and you're being asked to join in the ranks of those wishing to see change. Make sure you honestly assess all the available information before you automatically dismiss the situation as foolish. You should seriously consider lending a hand to the fight.
 ----- 
 Your inner strength and courage are tremendous today. You will find that people naturally gravitate toward you, Virgo. Accept this flood of energy and put it to good use however you see fit. A spark of genius may hit you sometime during the day. It will have you up all night working on a new invention.
 ----- 
 Wear the striped shirt and polka
 ----- 
 If you don't understand something, ask, Scorpio. If it looks different to you, ask why that is. Your curiosity is high, especially when it comes to the unconventional, and even more if it's revolutionary. The rebel in you will feel new purpose, and you may be tempted to throw a stick in the spokes of an old carriage that continues to head down the same old boring path.
 ----- 
 You may be shaken to the core today by someone of great personal magnetism, Sagittarius. Maybe you feel as if you're being overshadowed because of the grandiose ideas and mountains of information coming from this person. Perhaps you feel you're too slow. Did you ever think that someone is going too quickly? Don't automatically think that you're the one who needs to change gears.
 ----- 
 Your internal computer just got upgraded today and your head is buzzing with all kinds of new information, Capricorn. The good news is that you should be able to process all these bytes at lightning speed. Act swiftly and with great confidence. You can do anything. You could even talk your way into the White House for dinner.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit lonely today, Aquarius, even if there are people all around you. It may seem like everyone's on a different plane. Maybe you think you have nothing in common with others 
 ----- 
 This is a climactic time for you, Pisces. All your yearly cycles have reached a critical juncture. You may feel as if you're at a point of tremendous victory or terrible failure. Either way, it's important that you look on this time as a celebration that you've made it this far. Make changes where necessary and continue to reevaluate your progress over the next few months.
 ----- 
 Today you may contemplate changes in your home. They could be physical, like redecorating, refurnishing, or remodeling. Or someone could move in or out. Whatever the change, it's likely to be fortunate. If you're thinking of such a change, you can proceed confidently. You should be feeling especially inspired now, so be creative and manifest whatever has been on your mind for some time.
 ----- 
 If you aren't currently romantically involved, Taurus, today you might suddenly see an old friend or neighbor in a new light. This can be thrilling, but it might not be a good idea to do anything about it just yet. You're feeling especially sensual today, and therefore any attraction you feel could pass by tomorrow. If you're presently involved, schedule a romantic evening with your partner.
 ----- 
 Your financial situation could undergo some positive upheaval now, probably as the result of a career advance. This process is likely to continue today, Gemini, as social events put you in touch with valuable contacts. It might be a good idea to listen to others today and not try to voice ideas of your own or make any decisions. Too much input could lead to mental overload and a lack of focus.
 ----- 
 A powerful desire for change could have you thinking of traveling, Cancer, or perhaps relocating to a distant state or foreign country. Friends who live far away could be trying to convince you to join them. This isn't a minor decision. It requires careful thought. You might be tempted to act impulsively, but wait for a while. In a few days, you will know if the change is right for you.
 ----- 
 Some vivid and interesting dreams could bring a lot of repressed memories up and force you to confront them. This could be a bit disconcerting, Leo, but still positive. Psychological obstacles to financial success and romantic happiness could be cleared away, which could change your life. It's vital that you write down your dreams. You won't want to miss out on this.
 ----- 
 A transformation in your circle of friends could occur today and change your life, Virgo. Someone exciting could move in nearby, and you could hit it off. Expect stimulating conversations and fascinating new information. If you aren't currently involved, this person could be a potential romance. At least you will make a new friend. Take a close look and don't initiate things too quickly.
 ----- 
 Opportunities to do well
 ----- 
 Scorpio, you probably feel especially sexy and passionate now. You may enjoy browsing through catalogues of rich fabrics or furniture. Erotic novels could also appeal to you. If you're currently involved, you may want to spend the evening alone with your partner. If you aren't, don't be surprised if you attract someone new. Either way, you will draw admiring glances from strangers.
 ----- 
 Legal matters should definitely work in your favor today, particularly any involving property. You're likely to feel positive about life, Sagittarius, and your home life should be especially gratifying. Sex and romance also could be on your mind. If you can get together with a lover, you will probably grow quite a bit closer. Artistic projects, particularly regarding the home, should also go well.
 ----- 
 A call from a romantic partner could lead to an intimate get
 ----- 
 Creative projects that you may have been working on for a while could prove especially ego boosting, Aquarius. You're doing a great job. A change of employment and increase in income may be in the works. If you don't feel passionate about what you're doing, expect the chance to become involved in an enterprise that you do feel strongly about. New ideas and opportunities could change your life.
 ----- 
 You're an appealing person, Pisces, but today you could project more magnetism than ever. Don't be surprised if you draw admiring glances from strangers you pass in the street. Romance should be going very well for you. A hot date with a current or potential love partner could take place tonight. You might also be feeling especially artistic and inspired. Consider this a gift and use it.
 ----- 
 Friends or a group with which you're affiliated could want you to help them formulate a workable plan for advancement. You're in just the right frame of mind for this, Aries, and therefore willing to roll up your sleeves and pitch in. You might be the center of attention at some point, perhaps sharing your skills with associates. Don't forget your own goals. They could be advanced today, too.
 ----- 
 Career interests are advanced through clear, logical thinking and the sound application of good business sense. Financial interests look especially promising now, Taurus, so seize any opportunities for advancement that come your way. Working with others is likely to prove profitable, and could bring you closer to them, too. Roll up your sleeves and go to it. The results could surprise you.
 ----- 
 Social events, perhaps business related, could put you in touch with people in fascinating fields or from foreign countries, Gemini. Logical thinking and a philosophical attitude enhance your communicative gifts, so people will be drawn to you to hear what you say. You could make important contacts. Take notes. This evening could be a key turning point for your future plans.
 ----- 
 Ideas and insights coming from deep within your psyche are likely to increase your effectiveness in whatever work you do today, Cancer. Your mind is particularly practical and logical. When coupled with an increased intuition, these abilities are invaluable. You might be most effective working solo, but if that isn't possible, you should still accomplish whatever you set out to do, and do it well.
 ----- 
 Today you could attend more than one social event, Leo. Some of your professional colleagues will probably be there. Conversations are going to focus primarily on business development and the economy in general. A lot of useful information could result from social contacts with others in your field. Write it all down. You will want to remember it so you can make use of it later.
 ----- 
 You tend to prefer intellectual and philosophical rather than practical pursuits, Virgo, but today you may feel especially practical and more inclined to want to get as many routine tasks out of the way as you can. This could involve chores around the house that you've neglected for a few days. Other members of your household could pitch in. Go to it. You will be glad you did.
 ----- 
 An older person you're very fond of could visit or call and ask for your advice on practical matters. Clear and logical thinking enhances your intuition, Libra, and you might be able to put this ability to work not only for your friend but also for yourself. Your own interests will be advanced today in some way, so expect a good day.
 ----- 
 Logical and focused thinking could lead to social, career, or financial advancement. Your organizational ability and industry are keener than usual, Scorpio. You're likely to be able to make sense of murky matters that might not have been clear before. Paperwork could prove challenging, but you will be able to get through it today where yesterday you might have found it too daunting.
 ----- 
 You might be feeling very communicative today, Sagittarius. Concentration, logical thinking, and a heightened ability to put ideas into words enhance your own communicative abilities. Therefore, your gift of getting directly to the point in any matter is likely to clear previously clogged channels, impress others, and increase your self
 ----- 
 To those around you, you might appear to be your usual logical, rational self, Capricorn. Actually, you may be drawing a lot of your ideas and insights from deep within your psyche. You're probably drawing on experiences from your past, even if you aren't consciously aware of it. Even though the source is unorthodox, whatever you come up with is likely to have a lot of practical value.
 ----- 
 To friends and colleagues, you may seem to have suddenly acquired acute business sense. Your experience has joined with knowledge acquired from others to enable you to formulate practical ideas for advancement. You may have lost faith in your goals, but now they seem more attainable. What you've wanted for a while could be within your grasp. You could make some real progress.
 ----- 
 Today you're likely to experience a heightened level of intuition and how to use it, Pisces. This could mean advancing a career, furthering a personal goal, or helping a friend. Right now you may be especially good at sizing up people, and you're instinctively aware of how to deal with them. Make use of this ability while you can, because right now it could lead to success and good fortune.
 ----- 
 You and your friends may have been planning a party for some time. Now you realize it's entirely up to you to actually make things happen, Aries. It seems that if you're going to get anywhere, you need to take charge and delegate responsibility. You like to be in this position. Your great creative mind could give you a load of ideas for a party that no one will forget.
 ----- 
 Luck is finally on your side, Taurus. And you deserve it, because you really worked hard to get these results in your life. In astrology, as in life, you can't succeed just by sheer luck. Success is often the result of a lot of energy you expend or something you may have changed on the inside. So continue to give off the positive energy that's responsible for your success.
 ----- 
 The stars are pushing you to accept more responsibility in your life. In fact, you may not think you can do it, but everything will work out just fine. At the moment, you seem to have a special gift for leading other people, making decisions, and doing whatever is necessary to finish up group projects. It's too bad 
 ----- 
 You seem to have the bad habit of putting off until tomorrow what you can do today, Cancer, especially those little daily things that seem to pile up, like writing letters, paying bills, getting a health checkup, or cleaning the house. However, today is a great day to deal with these monotonous tasks, so seize the moment.
 ----- 
 When you least expect it, success comes into your life. You can say goodbye to the dreariness of daily routine, fears, and changing moods. You're now entering a period of wonderful good luck and success. All this comes despite the fact that sometimes you might lack confidence in yourself. That doesn't matter anymore, because success is on your side from now on.
 ----- 
 Life just seems to be smiling on you at the moment, Virgo. Some sort of mystical force has entered your life and is enriching your contact and with other people. It allows you to make a success of anything you undertake. Luck is really on your side, and you're on cloud nine. Have you made friends with the angels up there yet?
 ----- 
 At the moment, Libra, the planets are aligned in a way that encourages communication and the written word. Therefore, you may feel like taking the plunge and writing that book you've been thinking about for a long time. It will probably be a great success. You're very gifted when it comes to this kind of creative activity. Go for it and stop making excuses!
 ----- 
 For a while now, you've wanted to change something about your lifestyle or behavior toward the people you love, Scorpio. You want your life to go in a new direction, but you don't want to upset the people around you. Maybe your friends and family want the same thing for you. Do away with your preconceived notions about things and let yourself go with this idea.
 ----- 
 The period just ahead of you promises a lot of luck and success. The initiatives you will take in your career or personal life will come off without a hitch. You should think about trying some kind of new activity on a professional level. Take advantage of all the good luck in the air. Don't be afraid to burn the candle at both ends now and live life to the fullest.
 ----- 
 After a recent financial problem, you've decided to take the bull by the horns and do what you need to do. You're used to being in control of a situation, and small financial worries aren't going to get you down. After all, money isn't everything. On top of your ability to react to a problem, your originality and self
 ----- 
 You're entering a positive period of calm and vitality, Aquarius. There's a harmonic atmosphere. You feel very close to the people you love, and they will show you just how much they care about you. Don't try and understand the unexpected nature of the wonderful vibe around you. Just live life to the fullest today. Good things don't always last forever
 ----- 
 Certain people close to you are very demanding today. They may ask you to deal with thankless tasks that use up your precious energy. Avoid spreading yourself too thin if you want to reach your goals. Usually you aren't afraid of anything. Nothing can get in your way. From now on, take the time to think about things before you act, Pisces. That way, your dreams will come true more quickly.
 ----- 
 You may feel like you need to work for a cause or political party, Aries. The period you're in right now is bringing you closer to social issues or humanitarian causes and pushing you to think about what you can do for people less fortunate. You can help develop a new strategy as far as human relations are concerned. Don't hesitate to listen to your heart and be a little more generous in life.
 ----- 
 Unfortunately, Taurus, this may be a period of conflict and tension in your family life, especially where siblings are concerned. Don't you think it's time to deal with these problems once and for all? It would be nice to build a new relationship with them. It might be painful, but it's up to you to take the first step. Call a family meeting and put all your cards on the table.
 ----- 
 You now seem to be able to do everything you want to do, Gemini. Things are going well as you reap the rewards of important past decisions you made. The obstacles that tended to get in your way are history now. Your family is happy and healthy. Your success is encouraging you to make plans for the future. It also enables you to look forward to much better days for you and those close to you.
 ----- 
 You need to be more spontaneous, Cancer, and stop trying to organize other people's lives. You will see that it isn't so hard to just let things happen. The unexpected also has a special charm. You're a slave to routine. You need to take a big bite out of life and put your trust in chance for a while. The people around you would like to see more originality in your personality. Listen to them.
 ----- 
 You're a hard worker, Leo, and you expect the same from the people around you. Today you may want to take a look at your personal and work relationships. Demanding person that you are, you may be concerned about the quality of your friendships. Don't be afraid to separate good from bad. Life is too short to devote your energy to bad relationships.
 ----- 
 Watch for any errors in orientation or strategic mistakes, Virgo. You may be having some communication problems with almost everyone today. You feel like whatever you say falls on deaf ears and that no one really wants to listen to you. Don't get frustrated. Relax and see it with humor. Just be an observer for one day and see what happens.
 ----- 
 At the moment, there's a great deal of electricity in the air, especially in your life at home. Ignore those people who try to provoke you. Don't get involved in conflicts that could degenerate into fights. Go somewhere to be alone. Reenergize by really listening to your desires, feelings, and instincts. Why not spend the afternoon in a museum, for example?
 ----- 
 If people say that you're stubborn when you're just determined, let them talk, Scorpio, and do what you need to do. However, when you think you're being determined but you're actually being obstinate, you may want to listen to the people around you. They don't tell you to calm down because they're jealous of you but because they care about you. They may not know that you hate to lose.
 ----- 
 It's time to face up to certain things about yourself that you may have denied for some time, Sagittarius. You have only yourself to answer to, so relax. You aren't the first one to have to deal with old issues that probably aren't as shameful as you think. You don't have to be proud of them. You can't keep hiding them from yourself. This could cause more problems than dealing with them once and for all.
 ----- 
 It scares you when life seems like it's slipping through your fingers and you can't slow it down. But it isn't life that's playing tricks on you. You aren't seeing things as clearly as you should be. You feel a little left out, but don't worry. You're just out of energy. Try and think of this empty feeling inside as a kind of purification or a much
 ----- 
 When you were younger, your humanity and generosity seemed limitless. You felt very involved in the world and what was going wrong with it. Today you may remember these great dreams. It may be time to make some of those dreams come true. It would be especially beneficial to you if you could somehow connect this to the work you do for a living. It's never too late to make a dream come true.
 ----- 
 You've always been sensitive to the pain of an unhappy childhood, Pisces. Today you can no longer stand the thought of all those children living in misery, victims of war or other atrocities. And this becomes especially painful when you take a look at the happy children full of joy around you. You may think that it's time for you to do something about it. You may be right.
 ----- 
 What meticulousness, Aries! You may feel a sudden, urgent need to take a close look at your financial situation, wardrobe, cupboards, or car. List the things you need to do in order to fix them over the next few days. You're going to spend your day taking inventory in your life. Why not? It's important to get a really good look at the reality of things occasionally.
 ----- 
 You may be courting your lover today, Taurus. Whether you're in a relationship or starting one, you're in the mood to seduce your partner with a touch of sophistication. It's time to add to your natural charm 
 ----- 
 You will get the most satisfaction today through your activities with others, Gemini. So you should take the initiative and propose something you and your friends could do together. Be creative and think of something unusual, perhaps an outdoor activity like horseback riding, hiking, or an outing to an amusement park. Your friends will appreciate the thought you put into it.
 ----- 
 Cancer, today you will be like a good
 ----- 
 If you can't feed your artistic tendencies in the work you do, today is a good day to create a better balance and make your days more satisfying. Art isn't just for artists, Leo. All you have to do is take the initiative to create something and you will see just how good it feels. Have you ever thought about writing a children's book? This is one idea, considering the planetary aspects.
 ----- 
 Regardless of your gender, why not show a bit more virility in your relationships and actions? If you're dominated by your emotions, the day could be extremely trying for you. Protect yourself from your anxieties by talking things over with a friend or someone else close to you. This will help take some of the pressure off 
 ----- 
 Today you may feel a lot more energetic after a tiring past few days. When you're feeling good, everything's fine. You're feeling motivated again to get down and tackle the work that's waiting for you. If you have time to make some calls, don't be afraid to look for new prospects, because today promises some very beneficial partnerships in your professional or even spiritual life.
 ----- 
 It may be difficult to get people to listen to you at the moment, Scorpio. The people around you may even be annoyed at hearing all of your new ideas. The stars are pushing you to change your tactics before you alienate everyone. You won't get anywhere unless you're cleverer about getting your ideas across. Be subtle and you will have more success.
 ----- 
 You may not have been taking very good care of yourself lately, Sagittarius. The planetary aspects are encouraging you to be a little more disciplined in your lifestyle. Don't overwork, don't drink too much coffee, and try to eat lighter meals. Anything you do for yourself today could have very quick, healthy effects. Think about this as you go for a run at lunchtime or go to bed early tonight.
 ----- 
 What would happen if you decided to take care of yourself today, Capricorn? This is what the planets are trying to tell you. You need to relax, to let yourself be taken care of, and close your eyes and dream. Leave the daily tasks behind. You need peace and quiet. Lie down and release all your worries. You don't need to act and you don't need to react. Just relax.
 ----- 
 This is an intense phase of interior modification, both physically and psychologically. Don't hesitate to padlock your refrigerator and avoid your favorite stores, Aquarius. You need to exert a bit more self
 ----- 
 The period you're in now is about getting ahead, Pisces. If you've been dissatisfied with some aspect of your career over the last few months, don't wait any longer to do something about it. Things aren't going to get better all by themselves. You need to remold your reality to fit your goals and aspirations. This would be a perfect day to ask for a raise if you feel you deserve one.
 ----- 
 Discussions in a group you're affiliated with could get heated as disagreements escalate. A goal you've been working toward might finally near fulfillment, Aries, and tempers are short. You may avoid arguments, but the situation could still make you uncomfortable. You might decide to leave early and go for a workout or walk. This is a good idea. You will want to work off the frustration.
 ----- 
 Today you could put a lot of energy into mundane chores and tasks, as you won't want them hanging over your head and interfering with your evening plans. As a result, Taurus, you might feel very stressed and your temper could be a bit short. Try to control it and avoid taking your frustrations out on others. Remember, you will have to face these people again.
 ----- 
 You might be planning or leaving on a much
 ----- 
 Ambitious plans for your future could necessitate your giving a lot of attention to practical matters, such as finances. This could be a drag, Cancer, but if you're serious about your ideas, it needs to be done. A friend, probably a man, could pitch in and help you make sense of everything. Don't try to get it all done today. Your mind could get overloaded, which might discourage you. Take it slowly.
 ----- 
 The coming days promise a busy social time, Leo. You might host a party at your home. You may feel terribly rushed and wonder if you will be able to get everything done. Don't worry. It will all come out all right. Friends or family members could prove invaluable in lending assistance. At some point, you might attend or take part in a sports event.
 ----- 
 Your energy level should be high today, Virgo, so you're going to feel restless and spend most of your time out and about. There might be some chores you need to get done at home, but family members should help and you're apt to finish them all quickly. Paperwork might need to be completed, which could be the slowest of all your tasks. Don't get frustrated. Handle it and then have fun this evening.
 ----- 
 You may be looking forward to an evening with close friends, Libra, probably including a romantic partner. Occasions such as sporting events, movies, or concerts could be on your agenda. Activities involving children are also possible. Don't be surprised if you're inclined to sit quietly and let others do the talking. You might have a lot on your mind and need to let it stew for a while.
 ----- 
 Members of your household may feel a bit restless today, and therefore might spend most of their time out and about. You might take advantage of everyone's absence to catch up on work you need to do alone, Scorpio. This is going to be a busy day with lots of outside contact. Visitors might drop by and the phone could ring constantly. Don't be surprised if you don't get much done.
 ----- 
 Your neighborhood is likely buzzing with activity today, Sagittarius. New neighbors could move in, improvements could be made, and new businesses could open their doors. Expect a lot of visitors and calls. A man with a child could play a big role in these events. At some point you might decide to walk down the street and check out what's happening. What you hear from others may not be accurate.
 ----- 
 The promise of possible financial advancement could cause you to plunge into a lot of paperwork today. This could be related to a job, Capricorn, or it might involve a personal project that you've been working on. You might get so caught up in what you're doing that you lose your ability to focus and get too frazzled to finish. Remember to pace yourself and take breaks when you feel the need.
 ----- 
 Your physical energy is likely to be very high today, and you might want to spend most of your time out and about, probably in the company of others. You may attend a concert this evening or some other kind of entertainment that you really enjoy. There might be a slight delay in getting there, Aquarius, but don't panic. You should arrive eventually.
 ----- 
 This is a good day to spend some time alone, Pisces. You may have projects you want to finish, and you have the energy to get a lot done. You could feel restless, but socializing might not be a good idea. Tempers may be short and frustrations high among those in your social circle. Quarrels might break out. Get out on your own, then work on whatever you want. This way you will enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Your focus today is likely to be on learning. Something you've wanted to study for a long time may finally be within your grasp. Perhaps money makes this possible, or you've finally settled on a workable course of action. Travel might be involved. If you've been thinking about going back to school, get everything started today. If you do, you will probably attain what you want. Go for it.
 ----- 
 If you've been investing, look for it to pay off big. Or you could execute a new contract, settle a claim, or even win something. Expect the unexpected where money is concerned. It might have you reeling. In the past few weeks you've been releasing a lot of negative energy and clearing the way for today's good fortune. Plan to have some wonderful dreams tonight as well.
 ----- 
 Plans for a social event that you were going to host in your home may have to be changed at the last minute. Even so, it should go very well. You're feeling exceptionally sociable now, Gemini, not to mention romantic and sexy. If you aren't presently involved, expect to meet more than one possibility. If you are involved, anticipate events that will bring you closer to your partner.
 ----- 
 An unexpected letter or call could totally turn your working situation in a new direction. This can be disconcerting, Cancer, but it's a very positive and fortunate development. Relations with colleagues should involve new respect and enthusiasm. By the end of the day, you will likely feel very good about the way your life is going. Don't expect it to be the same as it was this morning!
 ----- 
 For you, Leo, relationships with other people should be going so well that you feel more loved than ever. A new friend or perhaps an old one you haven't seen in a while could suddenly become a powerful part of your life. You're probably feeling exceptionally innovative and more likely to make a success of whatever new ideas you have. Prepare for a busy and satisfying day.
 ----- 
 An unexpected opportunity could temporarily throw your life into disorder, Virgo, but you will see from the start that this is a definite stroke of good luck that you shouldn't let pass. It could involve money, a chance to move to your dream home, or relationships in some way. Whatever it is, you're definitely going to be happy about it.
 ----- 
 A lot of letters, calls, and other communications could skyrocket you into a new and unexpected space, Libra. If you've been thinking of trying your hand at writing or speaking, this is the day to work on it. All signs indicate good fortune will come your way at this time, though it might sneak up on you and leave you a bit disconcerted. Pull yourself together and go for it.
 ----- 
 Good fortune continues to come your way, Scorpio, and your life may finally seem to be moving in the direction you wanted. Today, however, you may feel frustrated by a lot of minor, if somewhat bizarre, upsets. Dropping things, losing objects you just had in your hand, forgetting names 
 ----- 
 All the planets are very fortunately aligned for you, and the coming weeks should be great, Sagittarius. Minor irritations today could make you wonder, though. You might worry that this good fortune won't last. Don't work yourself into a panic. This all continues through the next six months. However, you may need to focus sufficient effort if you'd like to make it last for a long time.
 ----- 
 You may wonder why increased intuition has seemed to replace your usual logical self. An unexpected intellectual, spiritual, or metaphysical insight might come to you from another realm. It may seem so profound that you wonder if it really came from you. Write it down in detail. Whatever you come up with is going to keep you in the clouds all day, Capricorn. Don't trip or bump into anyone!
 ----- 
 You should feel especially sociable today, Aquarius. You might attend one or more events, or perhaps you will choose another type of group activity. Relationships of all kinds should prove satisfying and comforting. Expect to grow closer to the friends you have and meet new friends with whom you share many interests. You continue to meet professional, creative, and financial goals in a big way.
 ----- 
 Today an important goal might reach a point you've been aiming at for a long time. All those in your entourage have new respect for you. In fact, Pisces, relationships of all kinds are warm, open, and honest, and you will probably enjoy the company of others immensely now. Romance, in particular, goes well. Feel free to indulge in a little celebration.
 ----- 
 A trip of some kind might have to be postponed, as computers and other technology involved in your arrangements might be temporarily out of operation. This can prove frustrating, Aries, but it's beyond your control. The best thing to do is make new arrangements and move on. For the most part, everything is going very well for you, so don't give in to panic. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 Some upsetting dreams might haunt you today, Taurus. They might evoke some uncomfortable emotional issues. You might be a bit edgy emotionally and more likely to overreact when other people quarrel or machines break down. It might be a good idea to analyze your dreams first thing in the morning so you can learn from and release them. That way you will be more balanced throughout your day.
 ----- 
 Machines are likely to pose a few problems today, Gemini, particularly where work and money are concerned. An unforeseen problem might interfere with your social life, perhaps forcing you to cancel a get
 ----- 
 Obstacles may arise in the course of your chores when machines break down and interfere with your efficiency. Your frustrations may cause you to want to yell and throw things. If you must blow your top, Cancer, do it in such a way as to avoid causing upset to others. Go for a workout or jog. The machines will be fixed and the situation will pass. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 Payment for work you've performed may not come when expected, Leo, particularly if direct deposit is involved. The planetary energies today don't favor the smooth functioning of computers or other machines. This is a temporary setback and not worth stressing over. Don't give in to the temptation to lose your temper. All will be straightened out and your funds will be in their proper place.
 ----- 
 Family members might not be in the best of moods today, Virgo. Frustration with machines or friends could have tempers on edge, so try to avoid the temptation to get into arguments. The problems will be resolved and the bad moods will pass. You don't want any residual bad feelings between you and them. This is a good day to get out and spend the day in the bookstore by yourself.
 ----- 
 Problems in your community may result from malfunctioning machines. Be prepared, Libra. Have flashlights handy in case of a power outage, and walk instead of drive in case signals cause major traffic jams. Neighbors may be going crazy, but try to stay calm. This is a temporary situation, and not worth getting all stressed over. A good piece of advice is to spend the day reading.
 ----- 
 Temporary upsets regarding money might result from a computer failure of some sort. Take care not to lose your temper over it, Scorpio. Instead, remain calm, focused, and polite until everything is worked out. Your financial condition itself still looks very promising. It's just that the planetary energies don't favor machines today, so they may all go out of whack. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 Computers and other equipment could go haywire today, limiting your abilities to work at maximum efficiency. Even though you're usually calm and laid back, Sagittarius, today the ogre in you may be tempted to emerge. Don't let it. It will only cause tension between you and those around you. Stay calm and focused, call in a technician, and enjoy the break from your routine.
 ----- 
 Don't try to sign up for a class over the phone or online today, Capricorn, as it probably won't work. This also isn't a good day to travel 
 ----- 
 No matter what friends tell you, Aquarius, this isn't the day to make an investment of any kind, from buying a house to starting a savings account. And this isn't a good day to invest online. The planetary energies don't favor computers or other forms of modern technology used in such transactions, so wait a day or two. Discussions about possibilities are OK. Just don't do it yet.
 ----- 
 More than one problem with modern equipment could rear its head today, Pisces. Computers could malfunction, crash, or be maddeningly slow. You might also have a hard time reaching people you need to talk to. Don't be tempted to blow your top. That won't accomplish anything. Just call the technicians and get it handled. Tomorrow everything should be back to normal.
 ----- 
 A quick survey of the financial news might reveal that your investments, particularly those involving property, might be worth far more than you thought, Aries. This might make you wonder if you should sit back and let it all mount up or actively put it to work for you. Consult a professional before taking any immediate action. You will want to be sure you're doing the right thing.
 ----- 
 A message could come today from a business or romantic partner that brings some welcome news, Taurus. Action on an enterprise of some kind, perhaps involving writing or speaking, could put one or both of you in the limelight. Make the most of the opportunity. It could lead to future advancement and exposure, perhaps even more promising than this. You've worked hard and now you're reaping the rewards.
 ----- 
 Today you can expect to have a highly interesting conversation with someone, Gemini. The person you will be talking to is going to provide you with a ton of information that will open a whole new world of knowledge. Excitement and happiness will be with you all day. This conversation will have an impact on your future.
 ----- 
 Your physical and mental energy are exceptionally strong right now, Cancer. If you're creative, you will want to put that energy into a project that means a lot to you. If you're athletic, you will probably want to get outside and play a game or go for a jog or cardio class. Bear in mind that much of this energy is nervous energy that burns out quickly. Pace yourself.
 ----- 
 A delivery could come to your house that you find very emotionally moving, Leo. Perhaps you've received a gift that represents a big sacrifice to the giver, and was all the more sincere for that. This could be on your mind for most of the day even though you have a lot to do. When thanking the giver, be warm and sincere but not too effusive. You don't want to embarrass your friend.
 ----- 
 A friend might drop by and want you to keep them company while they runs errands, Virgo. This might be a good idea, not only for the diversion from routine but also because something might happen in the course of these short journeys that points you in a new and very positive direction. Your mind could suddenly be flooded with ideas. Make the most of it.
 ----- 
 Paperwork regarding money might take up a lot of your time today, Libra. This can be tedious, but it's something that can make a very positive difference to you, and therefore needs to be handled as soon as possible. Try to stay focused, and don't forget to ask for clarification when you need it. In the evening, celebrate by going out on the town with a group of friends.
 ----- 
 A subject that fascinates you could occupy much of your time today, Scorpio. Questions may arise about this subject that you want answered now. Therefore, you could get into some in
 ----- 
 Emotions, impressions, and memories could come up from your subconscious today, Sagittarius. This may preoccupy you and keep you from other matters. This is a positive development. Pleasant memories bring joy. Disturbing ones offer a release from past trauma. Write down your thoughts and then distract yourself by doing something you love. The significance of this process should come later.
 ----- 
 Social events or group activities could prove more stimulating than usual, Capricorn. Discussions of every subject imaginable could take place around you, and you might have trouble deciding which ones you want to join. Your mind may be going the speed of light by the time the gathering ends. Walk home if time and weather permit. That should clear your head enough to let you sleep well.
 ----- 
 Your writing, speaking, and communicating skills are enhanced today, Aquarius. Therefore, you can expect to impress a lot of people around you who will change their opinion about you. People will express their sympathy openly, and you will feel integrated and accepted throughout the day. Tonight, find a bookstore that's sponsoring a lecture and go.
 ----- 
 Correspondence with someone who lives far away could appear to lead to something more than friendship, Pisces. This person seems to be in total accord with you about nearly everything, and warm feelings could flow between you. However, if you haven't met in person, you should, at least before you get your hopes up for a relationship. It may be just what you've wanted 
 ----- 
 Have you been thinking about attending a seminar of some kind, Aries, perhaps business related? You and a partner might go together. This is a good time to do this, as your thinking is particularly clear and retentive and you find it easier than usual to concentrate. Discussions with your partner afterward could be the icing on the cake. Tomorrow you will feel like you can take the world by storm.
 ----- 
 Have you been working hard to attain optimal health, Taurus? If so, you may suddenly notice that your efforts are finally bearing fruit. You should feel especially fit and strong, though maybe a little lightheaded. You will want to increase your exercise, and you have the discipline to do so. Make the most of this drive while you can. Push yourself as hard as you can without stressing out.
 ----- 
 A long
 ----- 
 A meeting, perhaps related to finances, might take place at your home, Cancer. For the most part, the meeting will go well and you will accomplish what you want. Communication flows freely and agreements are easily reached. Bear in mind that someone has an agenda of their own that might not correspond with the interests of everyone else. Avoid discussing anything that should be kept confidential.
 ----- 
 If you're into writing, Leo, this is the perfect day to sit down and churn out the words, even if it's only a letter to a friend. Your imagination is especially vivid, your expression clear and understandable, and your vocabulary skills especially acute. If this is a thesis or article, you may spend hours on it. Don't worry. It will be that much better for it.
 ----- 
 Do you have some paperwork regarding money that you've been putting off, Virgo? If so, this is a good day to get it out of the way once and for all. Your mind is especially sharp and your concentration strong, so you're less likely to be distracted or make mistakes. Take care of it first thing in the morning and then you can forget about it.
 ----- 
 Have you wanted to catch up on your reading, Libra? If so, this is definitely a good time to stay home, make yourself some tea, and curl up with a good book. If it's a novel, you will enjoy it thoroughly. If it's nonfiction, you will absorb the information quickly and retain more. If you're into writing, you might want to apply what you learn today to your own project.
 ----- 
 Intuition and imagination combine with good common sense to enable you to accomplish just about anything today, Scorpio. If you're into the arts, ideas could come to you in profusion. It will be easy to bring them into reality with a stroke of the pen or brush. The only problem might be deciding among them. It might be a good idea to sequester yourself and concentrate on your work.
 ----- 
 Conversations with friends take on a more serious note, Sagittarius. Spiritual matters and beliefs could come up, as could the more pressing mundane details of life. Whatever is discussed today could bring to the surface new ideas for making whatever you're working on move smoothly and quickly to success. Metaphysical ideas seem clearer and more down to Earth. Treat your friends to a nice meal.
 ----- 
 In case you're surrounded by a lot of people today, you can look forward to a very harmonious day, Capricorn. Your sensitivity is higher than usual, so you will be better able to understand others and be understood as well. As a result, you add another bond to your relationships, which will create happiness and joy in your heart.
 ----- 
 Learning comes easily to you, Aquarius, as your mind is especially sharp and retentive. Your intuition is usually high, but today it's especially acute, as is your concentration. Therefore, this is a great day to read or work on an art project. Set aside some time alone to contemplate. It may help you on a very deep level.
 ----- 
 It should be easier than usual to concentrate on the practical aspects of finances, Pisces. A keener mind combines with enhanced intuition to give you a special edge when it comes to making decisions on everything that concern money, so make the most of it while you can. Connect with the people you love tonight.
 ----- 
 You should be especially efficient in whatever work you need to get done today, Aries. Your natural eye for detail is especially sharp. You're also feeling industrious, energetic, and efficient, so don't be surprised if others give you some admiring compliments. When the work is all done, you might reward yourself by making some definite plans for a vacation you've been dreaming about for a while.
 ----- 
 Your dreams might be especially intense now, and some could even be prophetic. You may have recently dreamed of an old friend you haven't seen for a while. Don't be surprised if you suddenly hear from this person, Taurus. You might also come up with some previously unknown ideas for advancing yourself professionally. Don't let the unorthodox source of these insights stop you from using them.
 ----- 
 Social events involving both old and new friends could prove especially satisfying at this time, Gemini. You will be able to catch up with those you haven't seen for a while. You might also be introduced to new people who prove valuable business contacts in the future. Expect good news, stimulating conversation, and a lot of reminiscing about the past with warm and congenial companions.
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to get some annoying but necessary chores done, Cancer. You have the energy and stamina to finish them and probably will, although you may go crazy from boredom in the meantime. Your mind should be especially active, so don't be surprised if during the course of doing your chores you find the answers to questions you've been asking yourself for a long time.
 ----- 
 Some information that you've been seeking for a long time might finally be unEarthed today through your diligent efforts, Leo. This is going to increase your ability to take on whatever challenges you're planning to address. Your already sharp business acumen is likely to be enhanced by whatever you discover. Be prepared for a lot of hard work and continued success over the next few months.
 ----- 
 Virgo, some volatile emotional matters that may have reared their heads over the past few days could finally be settled to the satisfaction of all involved. The subject of money may come up. Happiness reigns in the home, as all the members of your household are basically pleased with the way their lives are going. The appearance of some well
 ----- 
 Some solid, honest communication between you and those you love is likely to clear up some confusion. Roles are more clearly defined, emotional problems clarified, and chores are more fairly allotted. This is going to make a big difference in your daily life. The removal of relationship issues will guarantee that the atmosphere is more harmonious from now on.
 ----- 
 Today you might feel the need to get as much done as possible. You're especially energetic, Scorpio, and you have stamina and focus, and so you should be able to accomplish whatever you want. Tasks and chores you may have put off finally get done today. Don't work too hard, however. You will want to save some energy for tomorrow.
 ----- 
 You might need to do some of the less exciting chores involved with creative or artistic projects today, Sagittarius. You're in the right frame of mind to get them done. Your efficiency is at a peak. A practical, no
 ----- 
 You may have let household tasks and chores go for a few days, Capricorn, so today you might decide to get them all done at once. You have the energy and the stamina to do it. However, take care not to get too caught up in little details that only you tend to notice. This can keep you from getting the most important chores done.
 ----- 
 Some letters and calls that you may have agreed to do for a group you're affiliated with might have to be taken care of today, Aquarius. Don't be surprised if you spend a lot of your time on the phone. It might take a little persistence, as some of the people you need to reach may not be in. But you're likely to get everything done. Your determination is strong.
 ----- 
 You may need to take care of paperwork related to financial matters today, Pisces. You will pay bills, make deposits, or balance checkbooks. Whatever you need to handle, you will get it done, and done well. You might even find that you're better off financially than you thought you were. In the evening, go to a movie and forget about money for a while.
 ----- 
 Changes you're making at home might necessitate your planning extra time, Aries. Perhaps you're waiting for a guest whose plane got delayed, or your shopping trip takes much longer because you can't find what you're looking for. Whatever it is, don't panic. Just try to stay rational and think about other options or alternatives.
 ----- 
 Are you involved in a search through every store for a particular item, Taurus? You might be looking for a long time. The object you need won't be found at the local mall. Secondhand shops, obscure boutiques, antique stores outside town 
 ----- 
 If you've given up on something you've lost, Gemini, you might get a real surprise tonight when a dream sheds light on where you might find it. It's important that you either get up and search for the object immediately or write the dream down in as much detail as you can remember. Otherwise, this could be one of those dreams that disappears as soon as you wake up, and you won't want that.
 ----- 
 A business or romantic partner might be in a foul mood and not very likely to tell you why, Cancer. It won't be all that easy to deal with, but it probably doesn't relate to any trouble between you. Therefore, it's best to let your partner work it out alone. Take care to stay cool and keep a safe distance between you, at least for today. The mood should pass by tomorrow.
 ----- 
 Have you been exercising beyond your fitness level, Leo? If you have, you're probably feeling very tired, sore, and out of sorts. Take it easy today, even if you don't want to. You can still exercise, but concentrate on yoga and tai chi rather than more strenuous programs like aerobics. Push yourself a little, but not too much. The idea of "no pain, no gain" is a fallacy.
 ----- 
 A goal you've recently been on the verge of attaining may suddenly hit unexpected setbacks, Virgo. However major or minor they are, it's going to be disheartening. The only thing you can do is pick up the pieces and move on. The goal isn't dead in the water. There are only some extra tasks that need to be done before you achieve it. Do what you have to, and hang in there.
 ----- 
 You could be introduced to a new person today Libra. He or she may be someone who will play a very important role in your life at one point. You will feel an instant connection and find out you share a passion for the same kinds of things. This person could turn out to be a very good friend, and romance is also very likely. Take it slowly and see what happens.
 ----- 
 Is there a secret you're obsessed with unveiling, Scorpio? Something strange could be going on in your neighborhood, or it might be an intellectual puzzle. Whatever it is, you're determined to discover the truth. You may do things you wouldn't normally do. Don't be too pushy with questions. Confine your research to books, newspapers, and the web. You can find a few clues without alienating anyone.
 ----- 
 Various intellectual or humanitarian subjects you've been reading about have changed your value system, perhaps subtly, Sagittarius. You may not notice it until you hear someone mention beliefs like those you used to hold. It might be uncomfortable to realize that such profound changes have occurred in you, but it's only a natural part of personal growth. Everything changes, so why not you?
 ----- 
 A temporary separation from a love partner might have you in a very gloomy mood, Capricorn. Attempts to reach your friend by phone might prove fruitless. You might grow more and more frustrated and angry. There isn't much you can do other than leave messages. Don't let your insecurity get the best of you. Find something else to do until your friend has a chance to call. Better late than never.
 ----- 
 Expect to be frantic if you have to take care of something that's time critical today, Aquarius. People and situations aren't in your favor. Everything will seem like a challenge. Prioritize tasks and do them slowly and cautiously one at a time. If you push too hard, you will make mistakes and wear yourself out. The world won't end if you don't finish all your tasks.
 ----- 
 Generally you avoid politics in any group you belong to, Pisces, but today you might get caught up in the fray in order to support a friend. This goes against your grain. Be sure and assess the situation carefully before getting too involved. Friend or not, you aren't going to want to alienate anyone in the group. Think about it. Is it worth it?
 ----- 
 The desire to improve your home's appearance might suddenly come over you today, Aries. Whether you're planning some redecorating, landscaping, refurnishing, or simply a thorough cleaning, you will probably take the bull by the horns and concentrate on nothing else. The results will speak for themselves. Get family members to help you. You won't want to be too tired to enjoy what you've done.
 ----- 
 Much of your day may be spent running around your neighborhood, Taurus, perhaps in the company of your partner. You may have a lot of errands to run, or perhaps you're just antsy and unwilling to spend the day indoors. Whichever it is, you may come into contact with some unusual people and events. Take a notebook and camera. You might want a record of it all.
 ----- 
 A financial windfall might come your way, Gemini. This may not be a lottery win or surprise inheritance. It's probably something you've worked hard for, but more than you expected. As a result, you could walk around in a daze for much of the day. Don't try to make plans for it. Put it aside until you're used to the idea of having it. Only then will your practical nature kick in.
 ----- 
 You're probably feeling full of energy, Cancer, and looking for an outlet for it aside from the usual jog or workout. A hike along a scenic path would be just the thing. Phone a friend and see if you can arrange to do it together. Your friend will probably be as enthusiastic as you. You may enjoy yourselves so much that you decide to make it a weekly event.
 ----- 
 Your subconscious mind is active today, Leo, perhaps releasing old traumas from the past. Memories from long ago could pour into your mind as though floodgates were opened. Many of them won't be pleasant. This is good nonetheless. You're releasing obstacles caused by these memories. By the end of the day you will feel so much lighter. Make the most of it.
 ----- 
 You tend to be an adventurous soul by nature, Virgo. Today the desire to do something you've never done before could be overwhelming. You might toy with outrageous ideas like learning to skydive or bungee jump. You probably you won't go that far, but you could opt for something like river rafting or mountain climbing. You have a lot of options open to you. Think about them.
 ----- 
 If you've been thinking about studying astrology, Libra, this is the day to do it. Even if you already know the field, you might decide to branch out into a newer or more radical aspect, such as Draconic or galactic astrology. You will learn more quickly and retain more of what you learn, so no matter what interests you, this is the day to put some effort into learning more about it.
 ----- 
 Your innate sense of adventure is active today, Scorpio. Travel is on your mind. You and some friends may kick around ideas for an unconventional trip to an exotic place, such as sailing to Tahiti. The urge could pass, but it might not. Do some research and find out what your options really are. It might not work out as you visualized, but a little adventure could do you some good.
 ----- 
 Career matters may involve some touchy circumstances that require ingenious methods to solve, Sagittarius. You're in the right frame of mind to come up with them. You're definitely up for a challenge, and you will probably dig right in and come up with lots of great ideas. These concepts will not only get you through the current situation but also prove useful in the future. Go to it.
 ----- 
 A social event could bring you into contact with some interesting people in fascinating fields, Capricorn, some from distant places. Discussions could turn you on to one or more new interests, which you will probably want to pursue later. You might receive an invitation to visit an exotic place. If you're single, you could meet a potential lover. This will be an evening to remember.
 ----- 
 A burst of physical energy might have you spending hours working out today, Aquarius. You might decide to try a new and ambitious exercise program. Take care not to push yourself past your limits. A heightened sense of adventure combines with a powerful desire to be fit, and it might drive you to exhaustion if you aren't careful. You have to learn to crawl before you learn to walk.
 ----- 
 Are you involved in an ambitious, creative project of some kind, Pisces? You might have so much to do that you decide to take on a partner, if you haven't already. When you and this person work together, the whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts. Without him or her, you might try to do the whole project yourself, which won't do you or the project any good.
 ----- 
 Now that you've earned your place in the world after all your hard work, Aries, you might take some time to pursue your own interests. This could involve writing or publishing, going back to school to get an advanced degree, or taking a trip around the world. You have the time and energy to think about all your different options, so don't feel you have to rush.
 ----- 
 Money that has come your way unexpectedly might have you thinking in terms of expanding your personal interests and holdings, Taurus. You might consider trying some new investments, particularly property. There's no need to rush to make a decision, however. You have all the time in the world to consider different options 
 ----- 
 You may feel so confident that you could be thinking in terms of starting a new enterprise, Gemini. Partnerships are especially likely to succeed now. You could also grow closer to those who mean the most to you 
 ----- 
 Recent successes haven't made you feel you can rest on your laurels, Cancer. Rather, you're more likely to work harder. Today you might spend a lot of time considering different options for improving your socioeconomic status. Among them might be enterprises connected with the planet. Business and romantic partners could inspire you.
 ----- 
 This is likely a day when you want to reflect on your successes. As your professional success continues to skyrocket, your sense of self
 ----- 
 Surprising developments in your life might bring a lot of visitors and much happiness to your home. You could host a party or other sort of gathering. This is likely to keep you very busy throughout the day, Virgo, but you will have fun all the same. Don't let shop talk interfere with times like this. This is the time to relax and enjoy your good fortune. Use it to your advantage.
 ----- 
 Some wonderful new developments could take place in your community, Libra. You might meet some new people who move in nearby. New businesses could also arrive and give a whole new look to the area. You could spend a lot of time visiting others to learn about what's happening. You might also consider fixing up your home, as recent success has made that possible. You will be busy all day.
 ----- 
 A high level of self
 ----- 
 Happiness is the mood of the day, Sagittarius, as you enjoy the fruits of all your hard work over the past few years. You're able to pursue a few things that you've never been able to before. You're likely surrounded by old and new friends, and romance is blossoming. You probably also look especially attractive now. If all this sounds too good to be true, wake up! It's happening!
 ----- 
 All the success and good fortune you've enjoyed over the past several months may have freed you from the grind enough to concentrate on spiritual or artistic interests. There may be a few surprises in store for you, Capricorn. You may meet some new people who share your interests. What you learn from them could improve your progress. You might embark on a new course of study.
 ----- 
 The company of good friends, perhaps at a group activity or festival of some kind, contributes to a powerful feeling of good health, good fortune, and happiness, Aquarius. You will probably want to spend a lot of time outdoors today. Sports might appeal to you. There will be a few minor accidents 
 ----- 
 Continued success and good fortune regarding finances could have you flying high right now, Pisces. You're probably glowing with self
 ----- 
 The approach of a very special visitor might cause you to thoroughly clean your house, Aries. Afterward, you could look for new and interesting ways to dress it up with some new plants, throw pillows, or other decorative touches. This can be tiresome, but definitely worthwhile. When your friend arrives, he or she will feel at home. Work hard and then make yourself look great.
 ----- 
 Romantic novels and movies could be more appealing than usual today, Taurus. You're in an especially intense mindset. If you're involved, your relationship could be near the point where it has to move ahead or end. Chances are it will move ahead. If you aren't attached, your loving nature will attract more than one potential partner into your aura. Be prepared, and expect the unexpected.
 ----- 
 Your financial situation could get a strong boost today, Gemini. This might be due to a contract you've just signed, perhaps involving some work you will do on your own rather than for an employer. The project may have strong personal significance. The creative arts could be involved, as well as technology. Be prepared for a busy month, but it will be a great one. Go for the gold!
 ----- 
 Today you may decide to study healing, Cancer. You could read about alternative methods regarding diet, herbs, aromatherapy, massage, or acupuncture. You might decide to learn some hands
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to sign up for an advanced course of some kind, Leo. This might include world religions or perhaps meditation. Stay out of bookstores, both physical and online. You might spend a fortune on books on your chosen subject. The effect of this is likely to be more profound than a simple accumulation of knowledge. Prepare to be transformed.
 ----- 
 A group of friends may invite you to attend a festival or workshop involving the creative arts or metaphysical studies, or perhaps both, Virgo. You might resist at first, but once you get there you will find the subject and instructor captivating. Afterward, you won't want to talk about it. You will be too preoccupied with your thoughts. Write them down. You will want to remember them later.
 ----- 
 If you've considered a career in healing, psychic, or spiritual studies or the creative arts, Libra, today the opportunity to make that dream a reality could come your way. A close friend could open the door for you. Your own psychic and artistic abilities should be operating at a very high level, so don't be intimidated. You're good at what you do and are likely to remain so.
 ----- 
 Romance could be on your mind today, Scorpio. This could be due to a recent wonderful encounter with a love partner. Since then, listening to romantic music may have enhanced your feelings. You will want to schedule another meeting, but you might hold back because you don't want to seem pushy. Go ahead and call your friend. You might be pleasantly surprised by the response.
 ----- 
 A very beautiful, romantic dream could inspire exalted artistic activities today, Sagittarius. You might want to paint, draw, write, compose music, sew, or cook up a new recipe. Whatever you do, you won't do it simply for your own amusement. You will want to show your work to others and seek their opinions and approval. Your business acumen could be as active as your artistic side.
 ----- 
 A rush of intense love and romantic passion for a special someone might turn your mind toward marriage, Capricorn. The wedding of a friend may contribute to these thoughts. Your partner may still have doubts about moving to the next level of commitment, even though there's no question that he or she truly loves you. Be patient and hold your tongue. You will know when the time is right.
 ----- 
 Today you could experience a strong desire to clear your psyche of past traumas that limit you, Aquarius. You may decide to register for a seminar or workshop of some kind. If you sign up today, all signs are that you will not only attain the results you want but you will also meet some interesting new people. Among them could be a potential love partner. Go for it, and have fun.
 ----- 
 Love, passion, romance, and marriage 
 ----- 
 This might be the perfect day to go out, Aries, or stay in and turn off the phone. Friends and relatives could be stressed, and phone conversations could touch off some misunderstandings and cause unnecessary hurt feelings. If you must talk to people, keep the conversations light and brief. You won't want to mar a nearly perfect day.
 ----- 
 Recent stress could leave you wanting to spend the day shopping for items that may be nice but aren't really necessary, Taurus. This is fine, since you may want to spruce up your surroundings. Take care you don't go overboard, and be careful not to take home something that you wouldn't normally go for. You don't want to have to return an unwanted object to the store.
 ----- 
 Uninvited visitors could cause some stress, Gemini. You wanted to spend your day resting, but now you have to entertain people, and this could prove irritating. It's better to keep the visit short and sweet than feel obligated to play host when you aren't up to it. You will want to stay on good terms with your guests. Be polite but firm and then relax.
 ----- 
 Some callous words spoken carelessly could make you feel hurt and insecure, Cancer. They may not have been intentional, but even so, bear in mind that they're only words. They tell you far more about the one who said them than they do about you. Spend the evening with people who love and respect you. You mirror the best in them, and that's why they enjoy your company.
 ----- 
 Attempts to attend a festival, party, or other group activity could be hampered by minor obstacles like traffic jams, forgetting things, and getting lost, Leo. This can be frustrating and irritating, but don't let it stop you. It's important to be out with your friends today. Fill up the car, get a good map, and make your way to the place by the side streets. Have some fun!
 ----- 
 Some friends may put you in front of a lot of people, Virgo, perhaps to make an impromptu speech or lead a discussion. Generally, you don't mind this, but today you're in a quiet mood and would rather stay on the sidelines. You could grit your teeth and do what they ask. But don't be afraid to tell your friends how you feel. They don't really want to make you uncomfortable.
 ----- 
 Someone who's a little belligerent and abrasive could interrupt the flow of ideas at a class or workshop dedicated to spiritual and metaphysical concepts and values. This won't sit well with you, Libra, but you aren't the type to be confrontational. Don't worry. Let the person have his or her say, then let everyone else debate. Enjoy yourself and learn from all the ideas.
 ----- 
 An upset between you and a friend might cause you to wonder what you did wrong, Scorpio. Chances are you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Your friend may have money problems and be too embarrassed to talk about it. Wait a few days and call again to see how things are. Your friend will feel more like talking, and all should be OK between you.
 ----- 
 Too many outside responsibilities at once could have you at odds with a current love partner, Sagittarius. Your beloved may seem to be demanding a choice between your job and the relationship. Don't read things into the situation that aren't there, and don't be too proud to talk about it. Pride really can come before a fall. Explain the circumstances in detail and all should be well.
 ----- 
 An unexpected problem with a task you're trying to finish could cause a temporary upset between you and those closest to you, Capricorn. This might have your family stomping out of the house in anger. Remember that everybody has their own concerns, and probably wouldn't have reacted this way otherwise. Finish what you have to do and patch things up later. All should be well.
 ----- 
 An upsetting dream about someone you love deeply could cause you to awaken suddenly in the night, Aquarius. You might have to ground yourself a little in reality before trying to go back to sleep. Stay calm. The dream isn't prophetic. It probably relates to your own fears about this person, or maybe even about yourself. Wait until morning and write down the dream. The meaning should clarify by then.
 ----- 
 A misunderstanding with a family member or partner could mar your morning, Pisces. One of you is less communicative than usual. It might take some effort to bring the issues into the open and work them out. They probably seem more serious than they are. Both you and the other person are apt to be stressed out and a little on edge. Cut yourselves some slack.
 ----- 
 Job
 ----- 
 If you're currently involved, Taurus, expect to feel a rush of revived passion for your partner. If you aren't currently involved, the one great love of your life could finally appear. You may meet this person through work, creative activities, or spiritual studies. Your new friend could be from far away and work in an intellectually oriented profession. Expect to spend the next few days in a fog!
 ----- 
 You know you're intuitive, Gemini, but changes could take place in your brain that elevate your abilities beyond mere intuition. Visions, prophetic dreams, and powerful insights into others' thoughts and feelings could reveal you to be a gifted psychic. If you've been training your abilities, this should come as no surprise, but the level of your gifts will. You will never be the same.
 ----- 
 Don't turn down invitations today, Cancer. A group meeting or social event could be thrown together with casual acquaintances, and your relationship with these people could abruptly change. At the very least, some will become friends. You might also acquire some valuable business contacts or partners. You might fall in love. By evening, you could be in a daze from the unexpected events.
 ----- 
 A financial windfall could come as the result of a coup that no one expected you to pull off, Leo. Everyone is likely to be very proud of you 
 ----- 
 Wonderful news comes from far away, Virgo, possibly involving writing, teaching, or publishing. Creativity combines with heightened intellectual ability to bring success and good fortune to your door today. You might spend the day in a daze, waiting for it to sink in, and the evening celebrating with friends. This trend is likely to continue for the next few months. Make the most of it.
 ----- 
 An enterprise you'd long since given up on, perhaps one involving the creative arts, may suddenly come up again, this time as a real opportunity, Libra. Once you know it's real, you still might have trouble believing that it's finally happening. Friends and your current love interest may accept it more readily than you do. Enjoy your success and make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Group activities or social events could put you in contact with a new, exciting person. You could feel a strong physical and romantic attraction, Scorpio. If you aren't currently involved 
 ----- 
 Whatever you've been trying to accomplish over the past several months could break loose just the way you want it to today, Sagittarius. It could come as a surprise and resemble a logjam that finally gives way. Nonetheless, this is your good fortune, and you and those who have been in the trenches with you deserve a few accolades. After it's all set in stone, go out and celebrate. You've earned it.
 ----- 
 Today might be one of the most fortunate days of your life, Capricorn. Everything you've been striving for 
 ----- 
 Information received through dreams and visions could trigger sudden psychic revelations of solutions to problems you may have been mulling over for weeks. What you realize is likely to clear up any difficulties and pave the way for success. The emotional release could have you feeling like a heavy weight has been lifted off your shoulders. Obey your impulses, and get to it.
 ----- 
 Some unexpected calls from friends or colleagues could bring you wonderful news today, Pisces. A serendipitous lucky break could end the logjam that has held up the attainment of all your dreams. Love, money, success in career and personal development 
 ----- 
 Some problems might arise with equipment that you use at home or with the structure of the house, Aries. Appliances might go on the blink or the plumbing or electricity could require repairs. This could be a drag. It might involve staying home to wait for help. Still it must be done. Find a good book and settle onto the couch. You won't have to worry about this tomorrow.
 ----- 
 Some disturbing news could come today, Taurus. This isn't likely to concern you directly. It's apt to be something about the world situation that might eventually reflect indirectly on you. It could be gossip about someone you know. Whatever it is, check it out before accepting it as fact. The information could be garbled. The situation is probably more positive than it seems.
 ----- 
 A rise in your income could lead to a transformation in your values, Gemini, particularly where business is concerned. You could be opening up to the vast potential for prosperity that exists now. This is definitely something you should explore. Take care that you don't lose sight of what really matters. Money is meant to enhance the other departments of life, not consume them.
 ----- 
 Stress, strain, and a little conflict within a business, romantic, or creative partnership could have you toying with the idea of ending it, Cancer. Don't do anything rash right now. Wait a day or so and then think about it. This is likely to be a temporary situation. If you break it off now you will probably regret it tomorrow. Spend time alone and give your partner some space.
 ----- 
 Today, Leo, you might feel a little insecure about your state of physical fitness. You could decide to make up for any lack of exercise over the past few weeks. This is fine, but take it slowly. This isn't the day to push yourself. Strained muscles and exhaustion could result, and that won't do you any good. Work out, but pace yourself.
 ----- 
 A friend may be going through some pretty big changes, Virgo, and come to you for a sympathetic ear. The problem is that you might be a little stressed yourself and not feel much like hearing about someone else's troubles. Show some compassion. Try to listen for a little while. You might need a shoulder to cry on at some time in the future.
 ----- 
 Too many demands placed on you by others could have you feeling used, abused, and stressed, Libra. You might come close to losing your temper. That isn't necessary. All you have to do is learn to say no. It might not be easy, since you tend to want to please everyone, but you have to look out for yourself. Help when the request is urgent and postpone the rest.
 ----- 
 Today you might have thoughts of expanding your horizons, perhaps on a monumental level, Scorpio. You might consider traveling or even moving to a distant place. Returning to school for an advanced degree could also be a possibility. Your mind could be on expansion less for financial gain than for personal growth. This is good, because the latter often leads to the former. Go for it.
 ----- 
 Today you may receive some information about how to increase your income in a short period of time, Sagittarius. This information may or may not be valid. Be cautious. Check out the facts before committing, wait a few days, and then check them again. Great opportunities abound and should be explored, but what you hear about today might not be one of them.
 ----- 
 Relations with partners of all kinds 
 ----- 
 Stress due to overwork might be causing your energy to flag somewhat today, Aquarius. You might even feel a little under the weather. This is a great day to stay home and recover. Stay out of stressful situations and do things on your own, preferably routine tasks that you can do without thinking. In the evening, order a pizza and watch TV. Don't make more work for yourself by cooking.
 ----- 
 Today you could feel a rush of sensual passion and desire, Pisces. You may want to get together with a love partner in the evening, but not be able to do it right now. Other responsibilities could get in the way of what you want to do. Perhaps it's best to schedule a meeting of some kind, even if it's very late in the evening. You will need the comfort if nothing else.
 ----- 
 You can look forward to a busy day, Aries. Don't schedule any additional tasks. Your home, family, or mate is likely to demand a great deal of you. In fact, Aries, your energy is likely to be stretched to the breaking point, so be careful to keep some strength in reserve for yourself. If you give yourself completely, you're likely to strain your nerves.
 ----- 
 You're likely to spend time with someone who energizes and rejuvenates you today. With luck, this meeting won't occur too late in the evening, or else you will have a problem going to sleep, Taurus. This energy is going to give your projects a much
 ----- 
 You may feel an urgent need to use your physical energy. This need will raise the issue of how to incorporate more exercise into your life. This would be an ideal time to join a gym. Participating in a group sports activity would be a good choice for you. Get started, no matter what outlet you choose, Gemini. Excuses won't be tolerated.
 ----- 
 A day such as today should demonstrate an old truth 
 ----- 
 Do you have a desire to go away on a trip? Would you like to live in Europe or Asia? These are desires that you may well have at the moment as you begin the process of widening your field of vision. See if you can set up a journey of this kind, Leo. People will have confidence in you now, so all sorts of possibilities are at your disposal.
 ----- 
 What's happening in your personal relationships, Virgo? It seems as though you're looking for a fight. Could it be that someone has stolen a leadership position out from under your nose? You have a tendency to lead any group, yet now you're confronted with resistance. You might want to get involved in a new group project. Doing so will help everyone reconcile.
 ----- 
 At certain moments you can feel where your destiny lies. Today will be such a moment for you, Libra. You may want to shift your fundamental orientation. Every area of your life will be affected by this shift 
 ----- 
 The day ahead will reenergize you after these last few days of apathy, Scorpio. Anyone who tries to hold you back today had better watch out, because you won't be in the mood to tolerate any objections. You refuse to be restrained. This is an excellent time to reinforce your reputation as an excellent coach. It's clear to all that you're the captain of your crew.
 ----- 
 Today you may be touched by a person who exudes the kind of determination produced by a combination of spiritual and intellectual strength and faith. This is what is meant when people speak of a leader of great integrity. The encounter with this person is likely to inspire you to commit yourself wholeheartedly to some good work, perhaps a charity.
 ----- 
 Have you been lethargic lately? If so, today is your wakeup call. You will be alert and clear about the task at hand. You understand that your help is urgently needed, and that there's no time to waste. You can expect to pour a great deal of energy into a single, well
 ----- 
 The day will be fairly eventful, Aquarius. There's some likelihood that you will feel suddenly compelled to settle a tedious matter once and for all. It may concern something in your domestic life that's been left unattended. You won't rest until it's finished, and you won't be distracted, no matter how you're cajoled to join the others. This problem is the only thing that will matter today.
 ----- 
 The day may be somewhat trying for you, Pisces. You may have a speech to deliver or a private performance to put on for your beloved. In any case, you will have to prove yourself, and you will spare no energy in the attempt. By the end of the day, you will be satisfied but completely drained. Plan to rest afterward. You will have earned it.
 ----- 
 Prosperity isn't just around the corner 
 ----- 
 You've never looked better, Taurus. As a result, people are drawn to you and you have an unusually large circle of friends. This is fun but time consuming, as everyone seems to want a piece of you. Try to keep your feet on the ground. Don't let your vision become clouded by all the flattery you receive.
 ----- 
 You've always been interested in the arts, and now you want to explore that interest on a deeper level. A visit to a museum isn't likely to do the trick, Gemini. Instead, why not enroll in a class or sign up for a lecture series? A few artists, in particular, capture your interest. Make it a point to concentrate on them first.
 ----- 
 Errands seem to rule the day. You spend most of it in the car, running hither and yon. Don't be surprised if you run into an old friend you haven't seen in a while. The casual pleasantries you exchange could develop into something more. Perhaps you will discover a common interest and decide to build a business based on it. Keep your eyes (and mind) wide open.
 ----- 
 The planetary configuration makes you likely to reap the benefits of all your hard work, Leo. The little windfall you receive is nice, to be sure, but don't think of all of it as fun money. Put a good amount aside in a savings or investment account. You can use the rest to kick up your heels a bit. Why not invite a friend to dinner at the nicest restaurant in town?
 ----- 
 Keep your mind on the present, Virgo. As much as you'd like to be somewhere else, your daydreaming is getting out of hand. If you're sincere in your desire to explore other lands, begin some research. For now it's better to focus on any problems that make you want to run away. Open a dialogue with anyone with whom you've had a misunderstanding. You will find this brings immeasurable relief.
 ----- 
 There's passion in the air today, Libra. You can feel it. The feeling is so strong that the air almost pulsates. What are you going to do about it? If you're in a romantic relationship, plan an intimate evening together, free of chores and daily tasks. If you're single, peruse your little black book and see if there are any relationships worth warming up.
 ----- 
 Has the opposite sex always been so attractive? Today they seem especially so, Scorpio, and capture your attention right and left. One person, in particular, you've always considered a platonic friend, but today seems interested in you romantically. Perhaps this person is just picking up on your vibes. He or she may make a wonderful partner, so don't immediately dismiss the idea.
 ----- 
 Your poise and gracious nature serve you well now, Sagittarius. The best thing you can do today is spend time around other people. Go to a party or other social gathering tonight. The evening is bound to be a resounding success as you radiate warmth and energy and people respond in kind. Allow everyone the pleasure of basking in your glow.
 ----- 
 Creativity and romance are a good combination, Capricorn, and today both are in top form. Why not get out the good stationery and craft a love note that will set that special someone's heart aflutter? Cater to your romantic nature, ideally with a partner at your side. Even if you're alone, a bubble bath will do wonders for your soul.
 ----- 
 Is a bit of redecorating in order? This is a perfect time to spruce up your home. Rather than rush into a project that you might later regret, Aquarius, it's better to spend the day with color and fabric swatches. Once you're happy with a scheme, then you can pick up a paintbrush. Think hard before making a decision.
 ----- 
 You have the creative ability to make a real go of your music or writing. Why not put it to better use? Are you afraid to take the risk? Today you may be inspired to rise above your fear as you read a book or hear a piece of music that moves you to want to create one of your own. It's never too late to get started, Pisces.
 ----- 
 Today you may take a look around your home and see what needs improvement, Aries. A pending visit from a friend or relative may provide the incentive to get things in shape. A fresh coat of paint and some new window treatments and rugs will make a big difference. If you don't have time for that, fill the house with flowering plants as an effective camouflage.
 ----- 
 Family, home, and hEarth are on your mind today, Taurus. There may be a community event that you attend out of a sense of obligation but stay for the sheer fun of it. Sometimes you get so caught up in work and the daily hassles of life that you forget there's a whole world outside of work. It does your heart good to take in a wider view.
 ----- 
 Today may be an odd combination of social and financial, Gemini, likely a combination of the two in some way. Perhaps you need to meet with an attorney and end up dining together. Or you and a casual acquaintance could decide to go out for a drink. Legal documents are highlighted, so be sure to carefully look over contracts of any kind.
 ----- 
 Even though you seem content with your career, you're ready for some change in your life, Cancer. This is the time to consider joining a group. How about a local book club? Or if you're more actively inclined, sign up with a tennis team or local running club. There are lots of diversions to occupy your mind as well body. The real upside is that you're likely to make some wonderful new friends.
 ----- 
 Even though you think of yourself as a rational person, Leo, today your intuition is so keen that even you can't ignore it. Rather than try to will it away, why not embrace the messages that bombard you? Give yourself this one single day to embrace the possibility that you may have some extrasensory ability. There's no harm in trying to understand the extent of your power.
 ----- 
 You may feel slightly bored and restless, Virgo. If so, an opportunity may come your way today that shouldn't be ignored. You may have a chance to take a trip to an exotic locale or attend a class or lecture that will open your mind to all sorts of interesting possibilities. Just because you only have one life, that doesn't mean you can't fit many different lives into it.
 ----- 
 You consider yourself a rational person, Libra. If you aren't a scientist, you should be. You view life objectively and rarely let extraneous matters cloud your thinking. You're likely to be taken aback by today's extraordinary events. Your intuition is so sharp that you can almost read people's minds. At first you think this is just a fluke, but you may be a believer by the end of the day.
 ----- 
 This is your lucky day, Scorpio, and you can expect all sorts of wonderful surprises. You may enjoy a financial surprise or someone could propose an interesting and potentially lucrative project. Take advantage of any opportunities that come your way today, as all signs indicate that new ventures will ultimately prove quite profitable.
 ----- 
 Passion is very much on your mind, Sagittarius. Unfortunately, you have a lot to do before you can concentrate on romance. Much as you'd prefer to put paperwork off for another day, you really should buckle down and get it all done. You will be relieved to have it behind you, and you will be free to enjoy the evening pursuing other interests.
 ----- 
 You're never at a loss for an opinion, Capricorn, and today is no exception. The energy of the day is such that you're happier listening to conversations than participating in them. You can't help but smile at the misinformation that gets bandied about. Since no one has bothered to ask for your opinion, you aren't about to offer it today. Tomorrow is another matter entirely.
 ----- 
 Finances are highlighted for you today, Aquarius. This isn't necessarily a good or bad thing 
 ----- 
 Conversation and travel are highlighted today, Pisces. You may sit next to someone fascinating on a plane ride. You two have much in common, and the time will pass quickly as you enjoy discovering more about one another. You're likely to exchange phone numbers, if not kisses, by the end of the trip. There's no denying the chemistry. The question remains whether you will act on it or not.
 ----- 
 You might try to learn a new computer program today, Aries. You could find it a little confusing at first, but as you continue to learn, you will find that it makes things easier for you. You should master it more quickly than you thought. This may sound minor, but it will improve your productivity from now on, leaving you time to explore other possibilities or attend to important matters.
 ----- 
 Today you may stumble into an unexpected new friendship, Taurus. This could come as the result of a social event or an introduction by a close friend. You will discover new rapport the likes of which you haven't experienced in a long time. You could spend hours trading ideas. Make sure you exchange contact information. You will definitely want to stay in touch with this person.
 ----- 
 A group meeting of some sort, perhaps job related, could take place in your home today, Gemini. Whatever business the group has planned should be taken care of quickly and then you will be able to hang out and socialize. You might discover new aspects of your guests you didn't know existed. This could prove very enlightening for all concerned. Your bond with them will definitely improve.
 ----- 
 A phone call from a close friend or love partner could bring a thrilling surprise your way today, Cancer. An event has occurred that you either gave up on long ago or never dreamed of. This news could necessitate your spending a lot of time on the phone or computer making contacts, but that's OK. You will be so happy that this happened that you won't mind the time you spend on it.
 ----- 
 If you own property, you might discover that its value has increased far beyond anything you dreamed of, Leo. This might involve real estate, but it could also involve other resources like stocks, bonds, or family heirlooms. What you choose to do with this information is up to you, but you will probably decide to hang on to what you have. It's just nice to know it's valuable.
 ----- 
 A surprising phone call or email could come your way today from a friend you haven't heard from in a long time, Virgo. This should make you happy, as you've probably been wondering what this person was doing. Some business changes may have occurred for your friend, but possible new opportunities might also be in the cards for you. Hear what your friend has to say, think about it, and decide later.
 ----- 
 Today you may discover that you have a previously untapped talent for the occult sciences, Libra. This might involve astrology, numerology, alchemy, or using oracles. A class or workshop could be involved. You tend to be intuitive by nature, and studying these fields may offer an opportunity to train that ability to a higher level of accuracy. Find an expert in one of those areas.
 ----- 
 There's someone you've wanted to meet for a long time, Scorpio, and today you might have the opportunity to introduce yourself. This could be a potential romantic interest, a teacher you've wanted to study with, or someone interesting you might like for a friend. Sparks are apt to fly between you. Don't hesitate, for this encounter could affect the rest of your life in some profound way.
 ----- 
 Do you feel helpless in the face of problems with technology? If so, you might surprise yourself today, Sagittarius. Some software that you use a lot could go haywire, and you won't want to take the time to wait for a professional. Some study could enable you to come up with the solution on your own. Consulting a professional could demonstrate that you're on the right track.
 ----- 
 If you've been thinking about studying astrology, numerology, or other occult sciences, Capricorn, this is the day to start. There may be a school or teacher that you've been considering. By doing this, you could open doors to new knowledge, meet new friends who share your interests, and steer your life in a fascinating new direction. Pick up the phone and take the first step.
 ----- 
 A woman you meet at work might point you in a new direction, Aquarius. You should investigate all possible options. This could be a new intellectual interest, a technological skill, or possibly a new and more lucrative source of income. It may involve an unusual field, but don't worry about that. The world is changing, so what seems unorthodox now could be commonplace tomorrow.
 ----- 
 A friend from far away could contact you by phone, email, or even in person, Pisces. This person might bring great news that suddenly turns your life in a new direction. This could involve a new intellectual study or possibly a new circle of friends. At any rate, you will certainly enjoy catching up and hearing what your friend has to say.
 ----- 
 A co
 ----- 
 Money matters may need your attention today, Taurus, and you probably aren't in the right space to think along those lines. Your mind is on different things, probably on your projects. Nonetheless, if you don't at least make the attempt, you will worry about it all day. Give it your best and ask for help if you have to. Once that's taken care of, you will have the rest of the day to enjoy yourself.
 ----- 
 Gemini, you tend to be a master psychologist. You don't need to know people well in order to accurately size them up. But today this ability could be temporarily lacking. You don't sense much from those you meet, and when you do intuit their thoughts and feelings, what you pick up isn't likely to be very accurate. Don't worry. Your mind should be back to normal tomorrow.
 ----- 
 You usually tend to be outgoing, Cancer, and you love talking to others. However, today you may feel far more reticent than usual, more inclined to listen than speak. There may not seem to be any real reason for this. It isn't as if you're depressed or worried. Don't worry about it. View this as an opportunity to hear what others have to say. You will be yourself tomorrow.
 ----- 
 Today you might wonder what's bothering a friend, Leo. This person may seem depressed and worried but not inclined to share the worries with you. All signs are that these are probably money problems, which he or she wants to keep private. Let your friend know you're there if needed, then concentrate on your own concerns. Your friend will share when the time is right.
 ----- 
 Today you might be temporarily catapulted into the public eye when you'd rather be alone, Virgo. Perhaps a premonition you once expressed has actually come to pass and others want to discuss it. Maybe you will be asked to repeat a story you once told. Your friends will probably want you to entertain them. If you aren't in the mood for conversation, it's best to avoid social gatherings.
 ----- 
 Spiritual or metaphysical concepts you hear about today may seem confusing and bothersome, Libra. You might go off alone to try to make sense of them, but this isn't the day to do that. You will probably only confuse yourself more. Think of this as a good day to collect information, not decide whether to accept any of it or not. Tomorrow your mind will be clearer and more logical.
 ----- 
 Today you might be constantly engaged in deep, intense thought, Scorpio. There probably isn't a specific matter that you're concerned about, but you may find that a number of different fragments of information capture your attention and get your mind going. Don't write this off as crazy behavior. Write down your thoughts. They may prove useful later.
 ----- 
 A friend or romantic partner may not be communicating with you the way they should, Sagittarius. Something is bothering your sweetie, and he or she doesn't want to discuss it. Even if you ask, the answers are likely to be evasive. Pushing won't be appreciated. Perhaps it's best to leave your friend alone to work it out. Your honey will tell you about it when the time is right.
 ----- 
 The health of a friend or family member who lives far away may be a bit worrying today, Capricorn. A lack of contact with this person doesn't help matters. You're usually the type to phone at the drop of a hat, but today you're less inclined to do this. You shouldn't make yourself crazy. If there's someone else you can ask, do so. Otherwise, take the initiative and call.
 ----- 
 Your intuitive abilities are flying high, Aquarius. Normally you're sensitive, but today you might be picking up on the thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires of strangers who pass in the street. If you turn this ability to those around you, you're likely to be able to use it to increase your understanding of them, and thus bring you closer together. Don't let this opportunity pass you by.
 ----- 
 Some problems with the structure of your house may need attention, Pisces. Perhaps the plumbing or electrical wiring isn't operating at maximum efficiency. It probably isn't a good idea to try to fix this yourself, but you might not be able to reach a professional today. You will want to get this done soon. Don't be tempted to forget about it.
 ----- 
 Take a break from your daily routine and get off the treadmill today, Aries. The world will turn without you for one day, so tune out for a while. Remember that whatever path you take is the right one. Regret is a useless emotion. Don't even bother with it. Enjoy the present day and all the small joys it has to offer. Communicate your dreams and bring things into balance.
 ----- 
 Things are flowing your way, Taurus, and you should find a great deal of pleasure in the company of others. There may be an element of fantasy about the day that causes you to lose track of time and space. Don't bother connecting to reality if you don't have to. Go to an art museum or attend a dance performance. See a movie and go out to your favorite restaurant.
 ----- 
 Don't try to nail down any answers today, Gemini, because you will probably end up feeling frustrated. The less you try to force your will on others, the more you will find that things just automatically go your way. Today isn't about finding solutions to problems. It's about enjoying what you've already learned and accomplished. Keep things light.
 ----- 
 Let your childlike side come out and play today, Cancer. Your dreams are in full force, so let them lead the way. Enjoy lighthearted conversations with friends about the latest movies or novels. You might want to go shopping or get a haircut. This is a good day to improve your general appearance. You have a much keener eye for style on a day like this.
 ----- 
 Take a break from the routine and get off the beaten path, Leo. This is a day to forge ahead with ideas and dreams rather than commitments and answers. Question things and debate the facts. Have fun whatever you do. This is the perfect day to go out and fly kites with your friends. All group activities are strongly favored. You can't go wrong chatting about the latest events in your life.
 ----- 
 It may feel like something has suddenly clicked into place for you today, Virgo, because you've found the missing piece of a puzzle you've been working on. The answers may be subtle, but they're there. Fantasy and a playful attitude will lead you to them effortlessly. Spread your ideas to the world, and encourage others to join in your daydreams.
 ----- 
 Things may seem surreal today, Libra, so don't take other people's chatter too seriously. This is a day to reach out and touch someone, so pick up the phone. It's a good day to share your dreams, no matter how farfetched they sound. Others may look at you as if you have three heads, but as long as you're being honest with yourself, there's no reason to be shy about sharing.
 ----- 
 You may find it hard to take a realistic approach to your emotions today, Scorpio. A sensitive issue may pull on you, leaving you feeling like you're out in left field in the way you relate to others. You might want to consider letting someone else take the lead for once, allowing you to regain your equilibrium before the next decision needs to be made.
 ----- 
 Question the validity of anything you come in conflict with today, Sagittarius. You might find that people act on incomplete information, and that they're falsely accusing you of something you didn't say or do. Work to bring harmony to the situation by getting to the truth and helping to make the real motivations known. Words may be charged with strong emotions, so be gentle.
 ----- 
 Today is a great day for you. You should enjoy a great deal of playful conversation, Capricorn. Fantasy is likely to play a big role in events, and you may daydream as you walk down the street. Don't bother with reality if you don't have to. You're much better off keeping the tone light and playful. Enjoy your fantasy world and feel free to invite others into it.
 ----- 
 There may be a rather confusing element to the day, Aquarius. You feel tempted to act, but some of the pieces seem to be missing. It could be hard to make a decision, since you don't have the whole picture in front of you. You're better off spending this day outside with a group of friends rather than trying to make any major life decisions or commitments.
 ----- 
 Be the star of your own movie and proud of the role you play, Pisces. You might find yourself taking on many different characters, depending on your mood of the hour. There's a special gleam in your eye that you should share openly with others. Don't feel rushed to get anywhere. You've already arrived. Enjoy yourself in the company of those you love.
 ----- 
 Some deeply buried feelings about your mother and family could come up from the past today and need release. Don't be afraid to show your pain and anger. If you're embarrassed to do it around others, Aries, stay home and deal with it. This is a positive development. By the end of the day you might feel as if a large weight has been lifted from your shoulders.
 ----- 
 Group activities in your neighborhood could lead to positive changes in your community. You will enjoy exchanging ideas and information with others, Taurus, and could come away from these activities feeling exhilarated. It might be a good idea to walk home, or perhaps go for coffee or a movie afterward. If you let the ideas buzz until bedtime, you might not be able to sleep.
 ----- 
 Today you might find yourself in the public eye. Acknowledgment for work well done could come your way. It might also involve an increase in income. This could be job related or simply a community project that you've been working on and accomplished successfully. Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame, Gemini, even though you might find it a bit disconcerting.
 ----- 
 Expanding your horizons is the key for today, Cancer. Communications received from distant states or foreign lands could have you entertaining the idea of traveling to those places. Learning is very much on your mind. You're probably curious about different cultures, ideas, and perspectives. Even though you might not make definite plans for travel now, you're apt to at least consider it.
 ----- 
 Some very intense dreams could take you back to the past, perhaps your childhood or past lives. Write down any dreams you remember, Leo. They might not make sense to you now, but if you go back and analyze them later, you're likely to find that they reveal a lot about you that you weren't previously aware of. They might even inspire new projects of some kind. Think about them carefully.
 ----- 
 An old friend you haven't seen for a while could suddenly reappear, and you might view this person in a different light as a potential business partner, source of inspiration, or even a romantic possibility. If this is your inclination, Virgo, don't write it off without giving it some careful consideration. Partnerships formed today are likely to lead to success.
 ----- 
 You're a service
 ----- 
 If you've been hoping for a lucky break, Scorpio, this is the day it might come, especially if it involves love and romance. Or you might have been hoping for acknowledgment on the job, in the field of education, or by someone who means a lot to you. Whatever breaks come your way are likely to move you emotionally. You won't be the same. Have a great day.
 ----- 
 Changes in your home could take place now. These are positive, Sagittarius, though they might seem a bit overwhelming. Some could even be described as upheavals. Perhaps someone moves in or out. It could even involve moving to a new place, redecorating, refurbishing, or perhaps adopting a pet. At the very least, expect some emotional changes within yourself.
 ----- 
 Some great news could change your life forever. It might involve a new partnership of some kind or opportunities in your community. At the least, Capricorn, it could involve changes in your outlook and attitudes about life. You could spend a lot of time on the phone with friends and acquaintances. You will probably want to schedule a romantic evening with your partner.
 ----- 
 Some changes regarding your career could make a difference in your resources. This could involve a pending raise or promotion or opportunities for freelance work outside the job. It might imply a new job, perhaps in a creative field. Whatever work you do is likely to seem more emotionally rewarding than it has been, Aquarius. This should boost your spirits considerably.
 ----- 
 Today you're likely to feel especially romantic and sexy, and anxious to get together with a love partner. This doesn't mean you aren't in the mood for socializing in general. In fact, you may look forward to meeting with friends. You should be feeling especially creative, and you could spend a lot of your day either planning or working on projects.
 ----- 
 Your practical skills should be operating efficiently, Aries. A creative or intellectual discipline that fascinates you might require some intense concentration today. You could spend much of the day in the library. You will want to take meticulous notes, but don't worry about it if you don't quite catch everything. Your memory should be sharp right now.
 ----- 
 Practical matters involving home and family might need some attention today. This isn't anything alarming, Taurus, just a few tasks that you may have put off, such as house cleaning or yard work. Get other members of your household to help. You have other responsibilities to see to. It isn't fair to have to do it all by yourself.
 ----- 
 Matters involving your community might require your attention. This is likely to involve communication in some way. Perhaps you want to make some phone calls, write letters, or place an ad or article in a local newspaper. Communication of all sorts should go well, Gemini, and you might find that it opens new doors to understanding between you and those closest to you.
 ----- 
 Financial matters might need attention today. Bills may need to be paid, checks deposited, and budgeting worked out. Your powers of concentration are high, Cancer, so this is a great day to do this, even though you'd rather be doing something more interesting. Don't despair. Your practical skills are good, so you're apt to finish quickly. Then you can go play.
 ----- 
 Some projects might require practical attention today, getting irritating little details cleared up and out of the way. Your natural efficiency is at a peak, Leo, so you will probably be able to get these matters done before you get too bored. The important thing is that you will be able to achieve the results you want. Go to it.
 ----- 
 Relatives or old friends, particularly seniors, who visit you today are likely to awaken childhood memories that you'd long since forgotten. Some of them might come as a shock, but they will all release hang
 ----- 
 Today you might spend a lot of time on the phone with friends, some of them seniors. Your conversations will be loving, informative, and revealing, Libra. As a result, you might decide to attend some group events in your community. A letter, check, or delivery that had been delayed might finally arrive. This is going to release a lot of tension, as you may have feared it had been lost.
 ----- 
 Today you could resolve to work harder than ever on whatever it is that brings the results you hope for, Scorpio. This is likely to involve nothing more glamorous than practical tasks, such as getting paperwork out of the way. Nonetheless, by the end of the day you should feel satisfied with your accomplishments. If nothing else, it should free you for more interesting chores.
 ----- 
 Pursuing intellectual interests may be on hold today because of career matters. Your ambitions, whatever they are, could get a shot in the arm through some new information, possibly from far away. This could be uncovered in a newspaper, book, conversation with a friend, or online. Whichever it is, Sagittarius, it's likely to work for you, so make use of it.
 ----- 
 Memories of past events that caused traumas that you're still dealing with could come to light today. This is a positive development, as the release of these old emotions could make it possible for you to progress more quickly on material and spiritual planes. You may feel lighter, and you could experience a rush of joy. In the evening, go dancing and work off some of this energy.
 ----- 
 Today you might see old and new friendships and romantic involvements reach a new understanding, Aquarius. This creates a stronger commitment between you and those who care for you.

 ----- 
 Today you might work on a lot of writing, Aries. It might be your own or editing the work of others. You could find what you're doing exciting and stimulating. Phone calls to interesting people could also take place. The only caution is don't tire yourself out. You could be on such an intellectual high that mundane matters like meals slip your mind.
 ----- 
 If you've been thinking of taking a long trip by air, Taurus, this is the day to start planning it 
 ----- 
 Paperwork regarding money might need attention today, Gemini, as you could be planning to entertain visitors. These are apt to be exciting people bringing good news and interesting information. You might also expect a delivery of some new books or equipment, and this should contribute to the excitement. The doors to adventure are going to open up in some way. Use this to your advantage.
 ----- 
 You might spend hours on the phone today, Cancer, possibly discussing opportunities to perform services for others. Your mental and physical energy should be high. You will want to use as many tools as you can to get whatever information you need, including books and the Internet. You're going to want to get out and walk or work out, as you will need to work off excess energy.
 ----- 
 New, exciting opportunities to earn more money might come your way today, Leo perhaps through new fields. Colleagues could bring information. Your sense of adventure is high, so risks might seem more attractive than usual. Don't get carried away. Don't forget to explore every possibility in detail before committing to anything. Nothing is certain, even on days like today.
 ----- 
 Friendships or love relationships formed today are rooted as much in intellectual compatibility as emotional attraction, Virgo. Stimulating conversations could take place with old and new friends alike. Creative projects go well. If you've been looking for some information, you should find it today. This should be a very busy, exciting day on a number of different levels.
 ----- 
 You're generally intuitive, Libra, but today you could be so sensitive to others that you pick up on just about everything. Stay away from hospitals or police stations if you can. You might absorb everyone's pain. It's better to put this vibe to work spiritually or artistically. Seek friends and colleagues who work with you in these departments and you should have a wonderful day.
 ----- 
 Expect a busy day, Scorpio. You're likely to spend a lot of time in the car running errands and paying visits, perhaps related to projects.

This might involve sharing good news or exciting information that can lead to intriguing conversations. The day could be stimulating as well as busy.
 ----- 
 Today you might want to put one last burst of effort into a project, as this could make a big difference to your income and status, Sagittarius. It could put you before the public in some way. Your physical energy is high and mental abilities especially sharp. Whatever you choose to work on will be accomplished quickly and skillfully. Relations with others will be congenial and supportive.
 ----- 
 So many ideas are flooding your mind today that you might have trouble sorting them out if you don't write them down, Capricorn. They could involve travel, education, group activities, writing, and publishing. You might want to discuss them with friends or members of a group to which you belong. Your mind is in the clouds, so practical matters could seem tedious.
 ----- 
 A copious amount of physical and mental energy could focus on psychic, metaphysical, or spiritual activities today, Aquarius. You're feeling especially intuitive. You could almost read minds. One possible channel for all this energy is service to others, perhaps counseling or maybe even healing of some kind. You might also want to write down your ideas on whatever subject interests you most.
 ----- 
 Social events and group activities are likely to take up most of your day, Pisces. You could come into contact with so many people you may not be able to keep track of them all.

 ----- 
 If you've been thinking about writing, teaching, or pursuing a career based on the dissemination of information, Aries, this is the day to look into it. Your mind should be especially quick and sharp now. You will seek every possible detail that could shed light on the pros and cons of making such a change. Your heightened pace can also benefit whatever work you're doing.
 ----- 
 Today you could feel like you have one foot in another world. It's a great feeling, Taurus, with a lot of love and wisdom mixed in. This could prove useful in relating to others. It increases your awareness not only of them but also of yourself. It could make a big difference in any creative projects. Don't let the day go by without making this feeling work for you in some way.
 ----- 
 A number of exciting people could attend a party or group meeting at your home. You're in just the right space to be a great host, Gemini, and you're likely to meet some interesting new people. Much of the conversation could focus on computers and other forms of technology or perhaps on astrology or other occult subjects. You should have a good time and learn a lot.
 ----- 
 A rally or other sort of mass meeting could take place in your neighborhood today, Cancer. It could be the most exciting thing that's happened to your community in a long time.

Expect at least one of your conversations to turn to the fine arts or metaphysics.
 ----- 
 Intellectual and spiritual discussions should bring you even closer to people dear to you, Capricorn. Relations with a romantic partner should be especially warm and intimate today.

 ----- 
 Work that you're doing either at home or on your home is likely to go well today and bring you the results you're hoping for, Cancer. Members of your household might want to pitch in and help.

This is definitely going to make a positive difference in what you accomplish. You're likely to be quite pleased with what you do. Exercise this intuition today so it will stay with you in the future.

 ----- 
 You could be expecting an important letter, call, or email today, Aries, and sit on the edge of your chair waiting for it. This might be from a friend or lover. It could be delayed, and this might get you flustered. Distract yourself and do something else while you wait. If you make good use of the hours, the time will fly by.
 ----- 
 Unfounded worries about money could plague you today, Taurus. Someone close may have given you some incorrect information, perhaps about your financial situation, but more likely regarding trends in the economy that could affect your finances. Don't waste time worrying. Check out the facts before driving yourself crazy. You will probably find that you've been misinformed.
 ----- 
 You don't worry too much, Gemini, but today might be different. Insecurity may arise about a partnership. This might be a current or potential romantic relationship. Perhaps there has been little if any communication between you and your insecurity is coming to the forefront. Don't let fear or shyness keep you from meeting this person halfway. Your insecurities are probably unfounded.
 ----- 
 Worries about health and work might be on your mind today, Cancer. You could be stressed out over whatever you're doing, and this might have you feeling less energetic than usual. It's a good idea to work a little to lessen the stress in your life. This feeling is going to pass whatever you do. Try to rest a little and have some fun in spite of the stress.
 ----- 
 Today you may want to set aside some time to spend with close friends or a love partner, Leo. Other responsibilities could have you on your own, taking care of errands and other important matters. You may have the feeling of being lonely in a crowd. Don't waste time feeling sorry for yourself. Take care of business and get back to your loved ones.
 ----- 
 Today you might concentrate on projects. These could be related to your personal relationships. Whatever the nature of your tasks, Virgo, don't be surprised if you find them confusing. You might be tempted to chuck it all and go out, but this isn't a good idea. Better to try to make sense of the confusion than put it off. It won't get any better with time.
 ----- 
 Libra, making or receiving an important letter or call regarding money might be on your agenda today, but circumstances beyond your control could delay it. This could prove frustrating. Take care of whatever you have to do. Distract yourself if you have to sit and wait. Nothing is worth stressing over. The call will come in time, so just relax.
 ----- 
 Worries about money might plague you today, Scorpio. They might have little, if any, basis in fact, as you're probably fretting over possibilities that aren't likely to ever manifest. A little caution with regard to budgeting and spending today certainly won't hurt you. It's best to be objective and see the situation as it really is. Otherwise, you could make yourself crazy over nothing.
 ----- 
 Today you could look in the mirror and be appalled by what you see, activating your insecurity about the way you look. This could send you looking for various treatments. Go ahead if you want, Sagittarius, but your impressions are clouded right now and you probably look far better than you think. If you get together with a love partner, this person's reaction should give you the reassurance you need.
 ----- 
 Artistic or spiritual inspiration could come your way today, Capricorn, although it might be muddled and you could be perplexed about how to deal with it. Don't try to force the issue. Write down your ideas and return to them later. Someone close might feel unwell, and you may want to spend some time with him or her. This might take some effort, but it won't go unappreciated.
 ----- 
 Today you may spend some time by yourself working on your own projects, Aquarius. The desire to spend time alone with a special someone may also interfere with plans you've already made to attend a social gathering or event involving a lot of people. You won't want to give up either, so you might try to find a compromise of some kind. Think about it.
 ----- 
 Various personal issues might be on your mind today, Pisces. You could want to work them all out without distractions, so you may decide to spend part of the day alone. Responsibilities from the outside world might make it impossible for you to take as much time as you'd like. Don't let it get to you. Work out the matters that seem most pressing and save the rest for later.
 ----- 
 Books and conversations with friends could take up most of your day, Aries. The intellectual stimulation could have positive and negative effects on your health. Positive because it raises your enthusiasm and puts you in an enthusiastic state of mind, and negative because it might get you so excited that you forget to eat or rest. Enjoy all the excitement but don't forget to take a break.
 ----- 
 If you're currently romantically involved, expect your relationship to reach a new understanding and sense of unity, Taurus. If you aren't involved, you could meet someone special today, and it might be like love at first sight. An instant bond could form between you because of mutual intellectual interests. You might have a lot to talk about, as your own projects are going better than you'd hoped.
 ----- 
 An old friend you haven't seen in a long time could turn up. This should be a pleasant surprise, Gemini, as you will have a lot of catching up to do. You might have good news, as you've been busy and could have come across some very exciting information. Take a walk at the end of the day or you might not be able to sleep.
 ----- 
 Some great news could come today that turns your life upside down momentarily. Cancer, you will find it very exciting. New neighbors could move in and you might spend some time getting acquainted. Much of your day could be spent seeking information in a field that interests you. Expect a busy day, but remember to rest now and then. A walk in the evening might be a good idea.
 ----- 
 News might bring exciting opportunities for increasing your income, Leo. Perhaps you will learn of ways to start your own business. Maybe the demand for people with your skills has increased. You might discover the efficiency some new technology for managing your finances. Discussions with others should bring many new ideas your way. Make the most of them.
 ----- 
 Discussions could bring some exciting information your way that alters your thinking slightly. You tend to be oriented toward social, political, or humanitarian issues, Virgo. Today you might have the chance to put your talents to work. Someone could ask you for assistance. You have the mental and physical energy to go for it, so it's likely that you will, though perhaps not right away.
 ----- 
 Today you may take up the study of astrology, numerology, alchemy, or other occult discipline. Your intellectual abilities are particularly sharp, Libra, so you may want to combine them with your tendency toward mysticism. This should keep you busy for much of the day, but you need to watch out for intellectual overload. You don't want to forget what you've learned. Take notes.
 ----- 
 New friends, new goals, and new attitudes could all appear on the scene, Scorpio. Unexpected developments within a group are likely to require reevaluating a course of action. This is probably a positive development, and it could be exciting, but it's going to mean some immediate adjustments. As your mental energy is still sharp, this shouldn't be too difficult.
 ----- 
 If you've been aiming for a specific career goal, Sagittarius, it might suddenly manifest with the current planetary energy. You could be catapulted into the public eye in some way. The possibility of an increased income could arise, although it might be speculative at this point. Your mental energy continues high, so you should be able to easily grasp all the ins and outs of your situation.
 ----- 
 This should be a stimulating day, Capricorn. The possibility of a journey might arise unexpectedly. This could be exciting as some close friends or a romantic partner might accompany you. A new turn in your intellectual or spiritual interests could have your mind going a thousand miles an hour. You will want to learn more about it. The Internet could have useful information. Make the most of it.
 ----- 
 Unexpected economic developments might make a sudden and positive difference in your situation, Aquarius. Perhaps your field becomes more competitive, and people with your skills are more in demand. Whatever it is, you can expect more money to come your way in the future. Legal papers could be involved, as could some interesting people you haven't met before. Your mind is likely to be buzzing.
 ----- 
 Your social life might suddenly be busier than you expected, Pisces, perhaps because of the appearance of some interesting new people. This could involve a group with which you're affiliated, perhaps one with a humanitarian focus. Expect to be busy over the next few weeks, as this trend isn't likely to slow down soon. Stimulating conversations could set your mind going a mile a minute.
 ----- 
 A prominent male author whose work you enjoy might publish a new book. You may consider doing some writing of your own, particularly if you have a story to tell. On a more mundane level, your day could require that you spend a lot of time in the car or on the phone when you'd rather be reading. Be sure to schedule time to relax in the evening.
 ----- 
 Good news regarding writing, speaking, or publishing could come your way today. You might feel terribly bored with life and suddenly have the urge to get away for a while. This isn't a bad idea, Taurus. Make a few phone calls. Invite a friend over and discuss it with him or her. You've been working hard and a little break is probably in order.
 ----- 
 Paperwork regarding a bonus, settlement, or dividend of some kind might need to be executed today. It will probably be boring. You will get it done. Sudden insights, revelations, or flights of fancy might provide fodder for creative activities, particularly writing or speaking. Write these ideas down. You have a good memory, Gemini, but you will want to recall every detail.
 ----- 
 Strained nerves and trepidation about unpleasant tasks could have you on edge and likely to take your stress out on those closest to you. Try to avoid this, Cancer. Go for a walk. Release your stress through exercise or writing. Communicate your feelings to friends and assure them you aren't upset with them. In this way, you will get through the day with little damage.
 ----- 
 You might feel overworked today. Your energy could be flagging, and you may even feel feverish. This is probably nothing more than stress, Leo. Most likely you should take time out from your busy life and relax. Spend the afternoon at the movies. Treat yourself to dinner out. Buy yourself a present. Tomorrow you should feel better again.
 ----- 
 Today you're apt to feel especially romantic. Novels, movies, and poetry about love will be appealing. If you're currently romantically involved, consider planning a special evening with your partner. If you aren't involved, you might want to attend a sporting event. Plan an enjoyable evening, Virgo. Who knows? You could meet someone new and exciting!
 ----- 
 A rush of activity at home is probably going to involve preparations for a journey or event. More than one visitor could arrive during the course of the day. Your mind may be going in several different directions, and this could prove a bit disconcerting. Try to take breaks and remain centered, Libra. You won't accomplish anything if you work yourself into a panic.
 ----- 
 You may experience increased physical and mental activity today. Perhaps you will have to do a lot of reading or writing very quickly, make a number of phone calls, or run more errands than you have time for. This can prove frustrating and overwhelming, but if you plan carefully, Scorpio, you should be able to get it all done on schedule. Get busy and go to it.
 ----- 
 You might discover a hidden talent for writing, or if you already know this, you may find that your skill is greater than you suspected. You might have to execute some paperwork regarding money, Sagittarius, but you will get this done quickly and efficiently. At some point during the day you're likely to get a little frazzled, but this will pass. Get your work done and then relax.
 ----- 
 You might feel on edge today but not know why. You may jump at unexpected noises or think you see or hear things that aren't there. You aren't going crazy. This is caused by the current planetary configuration. The best way to relieve the jumpiness is to get some exercise 
 ----- 
 You may wonder if you're losing your memory today. You might have the strange feeling that there was something you had to do but can't quite remember what. Don't worry about it, Aquarius. If you push yourself too hard, you will drive yourself crazy. Your imagination could come up with ideas for stories and poems. Write them down. You will want to remember them.
 ----- 
 Today you might have to do a lot of communicating with friends. Perhaps you need to make phone calls or catch up on correspondence. You may be on the verge of attaining a goal. Consider giving it that last little spurt of energy to complete. This could involve a lot of time in the car or on the phone, Pisces, but stick with it. You will be glad you did.
 ----- 
 Too much reading might have you experiencing eyestrain and possibly headaches, Aries. It might help to have your eyes checked, but it's probably just too much stress. You might have some trouble focusing on whatever work you do today, but this is only a temporary condition. You should be back to your normal self tomorrow. Stay home tonight, listen to music, and take it easy.
 ----- 
 Doubts about business and financial matters might weigh on your mind now, Taurus, so much so that they invade your dreams. The dreams are only a reflection of your worries 
 ----- 
 A scheduling conflict may come up today, Gemini. A business engagement could interfere with a social event. You might doubt whether you can attend both, but if you plan carefully, it should be OK. Someone at home might not be communicative, which could cause a little worry. This person has issues they need to work out for themselves. Just be there if needed.
 ----- 
 Confusing communications could be the pattern for today, Cancer. Some paperwork you need to do for a task might be delayed 
 ----- 
 Today you could doubt the amount of money you might get from a business transaction. If you can, verify this before starting anything. You aren't being told something. Personal relationships, particularly love and romance, should be stable and rewarding now, although today you may not have much time to spend with those you care about. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 Business transactions that could take place in your home or perhaps involve the home might seem a bit unclear today, Virgo. Before agreeing to anything, read the fine print and verify all the facts about what you're signing. Use your intuition. It's very high at this time. Family members might be confused about events in their lives, but they'll get over it.
 ----- 
 You might get a lot of mixed messages from friends, relatives, and colleagues, Libra. They may say one thing while you sense that they mean something else. Insist on hearing how they really feel. This can prevent a lot of resentment later. New businesses could open in your neighborhood that you might want to check out. Take a look 
 ----- 
 Today you might not feel secure about your financial situation, Scorpio, and get a little nervous. Disconcerting information in the news about the general state of the world economy might have planted some unsettling seeds in your mind. On the whole, you should be pretty financially stable now, and this trend is likely to continue. Check out the facts before giving in to panic.
 ----- 
 Some unsettling news about your work situation might reach you today and make you worried, Sagittarius. You might question your future in this field and possibly consider a change. Consider it, by all means, but this isn't the day to make a final decision of any kind. Wait until you're in a more secure frame of mind. In the meantime, list your different options. This will get you back to reality.
 ----- 
 You're a logical person, Capricorn. When insights come to you through ESP, you tend to doubt their validity. Don't do this. If a feeling is particularly strong, go with it. Don't write it off because it seems illogical. Life isn't always predictable. If you give yourself permission, you can trust your intuition about nearly anything.
 ----- 
 Doubts about a friend's motives could plague you today, Aquarius. This person seems to be acting strangely and isn't communicating. This probably has little if anything to do with you. This person has issues that he or she is having trouble with. There are others who are in a better space whose company you will enjoy at this time. Get together and enjoy the amiable atmosphere.
 ----- 
 A friend or family member might act strangely and seem distracted. You may wonder if he or she is upset with you. This probably isn't the case. This person has issues that need attention. Allow them some space. A romantic partner might have to break a date tonight. Spend the evening alone with a novel and look forward to the next get
 ----- 
 Unexpected responsibilities could interfere with plans to take a trip of some sort. Someone might need your help, and you may well have to put your own activities on hold for a while. This could be frustrating, Aries. It only delays whatever you're doing but doesn't stop it. Take care of whatever you need to do and then continue with your plans. You will feel better if you do.
 ----- 
 An unexpected development might interfere with your plans to attend a social event, group activity, or get

 Arrangements for a get
 ----- 
 Your usually abundant energy may experience a sudden setback today, Cancer. Work pressure could create stress that leaves you feeling exhausted and out of sorts. This will pass. You should be strong and healthy and so able to overcome it quickly. It's going to drive you crazy to not feel as active as you usually are. Relax and spend a day resting. It won't hurt you in the long run.
 ----- 
 A trip through exclusive boutiques or antique shops might have you throwing financial caution to the wind and buying luxury items you hadn't planned for. This is all right 
 ----- 
 Unexpected visitors might throw you into a dither. You could panic over how to dress, what to say, and what to serve. Don't make yourself crazy, Virgo. Follow your heart and go with the flow. Spontaneity is the best policy. Your guests will enjoy yourselves more if you worry less about being the perfect host. Just have fun.
 ----- 
 Some rather disconcerting information may come to light today. This could throw you into a daze, as it isn't anything that you expected. This isn't necessarily bad news, Libra. In fact, it might be great news, but it may be something you never expected in a million years. Work through the shock and try to view it from all sides.
 ----- 
 Even though everything is going well for you, Scorpio, a sudden upset of some kind, probably involving money, could throw you into a momentary panic. You may wonder if your good fortune is going to end as quickly as it began. This probably isn't the case. The situation is temporary. With a little effort, you should be able to straighten everything out and put yourself back on track.
 ----- 
 Upsets regarding your career or the activities that take up most of your time are likely to negatively affect your self
 ----- 
 New scientific or archaeological discoveries could temporarily shake your faith in your spiritual path, Capricorn. You may suddenly doubt something you've always accepted. This could propel you to study, primarily to reaffirm your faith. You're likely to find that your discoveries don't invalidate your ideas, but actually confirm them. Write down your ideas so you can put things in proper perspective.
 ----- 
 You might not be able to accomplish what you'd hoped today, Aquarius. Some minor but irritating conflicts could occur within a group. You might find this exasperating, as petty squabbles interfere with reaching the group's objectives. You could be called on to use your intuition and sensitivity to spread oil on troubled waters. Be direct, fair, and clear, and try not to let your irritation show.
 ----- 
 A temporary upset with a partner might distract you so you can't function as effectively as you normally do. Don't let your anger get the best of you. The situation is probably due to a lack of communication, and could be cleared up with explanations, understanding, and an agreement as to how similar situations should be handled. By the end of the day, all should be well again.
 ----- 
 Discussions with those close to you could lead to the discovery of new concepts, perhaps from foreign cultures. You will want to learn more about them, Aries, as will your friends. You might even decide to plan a trip to a place where you could expand your knowledge of this new interest. Any trip planned today should go smoothly and be quite rewarding. Don't hesitate.
 ----- 
 Emotions that run very deep should bring you a lot of satisfaction today, Taurus. Relationships of all kinds could also be especially promising. A romantic relationship may be consummated, revitalized, or moved to the next level of commitment. Close friendships might become closer because of your mutual interests. Happiness and satisfaction should reign in the home today.
 ----- 
 Relations with neighbors, siblings, or other relatives could get a shot in the arm now, Gemini. For some, your recent business successes cause them to get on the bandwagon. For others, your personal growth could increase their admiration of you. Partnerships of any kind formed today show great promise of success. These could be business, personal, or romantic. Don't be shy. Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 Success in your work continues to bring good fortune your way. Today you might get reassurance that this isn't a flash in the pan. You're likely to be financially secure for a long time. You're probably feeling strong and robust, full of energy and stamina, and ready to take on just about any challenge. Move ahead, Cancer, but move with caution. You're never too prosperous to be careful.
 ----- 
 As you continue to enjoy success and good fortune, your self
 ----- 
 Today your sensitivity joins forces with practicality. Intuitive insights could come to you today, and you might express your new ideas to others, Virgo. Don't be surprised if they accept them. Your unconscious mind is on a far more practical track than you may assume. Make use of this ability while you can because it might not be so clear tomorrow. Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 Today shows the promise of being a very busy yet fulfilling day, Libra. Enterprises involving corporations, churches, or other groups in your community are likely to benefit from your participation. You combine intuition with practicality in everything you do. You're especially communicative and good at dealing with others. Don't be surprised if public recognition comes your way.
 ----- 
 Your financial success over the past several weeks may seem too good to be true, Scorpio. It might make yet another leap forward. This should make you happy. It also could bring up your insecurity over whether or not this cycle will continue. It probably will for a while. It might be a good idea to save or invest you money, just so you can feel more secure in the future.
 ----- 
 You're flying high at this point, Sagittarius, enjoying the success you've achieved over the past several weeks. Today you could accomplish yet another goal, adding to your feeling of accomplishment. You might plan a vacation or perhaps return to college. The expansion of your horizons hasn't left you complacent. Instead, you want to continue expanding. This is a very positive development. Go for it.
 ----- 
 Today you might have insights as to how to advance your career. These could come your way through dreams, sudden revelations, or perhaps visions. Don't hesitate to put them into action simply because of the unorthodox way they come to you, Capricorn. Some of the most progressive and successful ideas have come because the inventor had a vivid dream. Write down your insights and go for it.
 ----- 
 All your relationships should be especially warm and supportive now, Aquarius. This is a great day to form a business, personal, or romantic partnership. Business partnerships made now should be successful, while committed romantic bonds entered into today could well last for a long time. Be open, honest, and unafraid to speak your mind. You might find that others share your thoughts.
 ----- 
 Everything should be going great for your career, Pisces. It may all seem too good to be true, but rest assured that it's real. Events could involve a job change, promotion, raise, or the opportunity to strike out on your own. Don't kid yourself. A lot of challenges lie ahead, but this should all lead to great personal satisfaction in the long run. Go for it.
 ----- 
 You may not be sure what to think today, Aries. Mental confusion could be the day's theme for you, but don't let it get you down. Realize that it's just one of those days when none of the pieces fit right. The truth is that they do fit somewhere, just not now. Lay low and wait for this phase to pass. Things will pick up soon as the fog lifts and you can see clearly again.
 ----- 
 Spiritual concerns are a bigger issue for you today, Taurus. You may have found that you're drawn to a fanciful mindset and unorthodox way of viewing the world. Pursue this realm of thought and trust that your intuition knows exactly where to take you. Emotional tension may run high, so try not to get down on other people's "me first" attitude.
 ----- 
 Does it seem like your life is pulling apart at the seams, Gemini? Perhaps it's time to reevaluate. Major aspects of your being could be coming into question and you can't seem to find the answer to why you started down this road in the first place. Have confidence in yourself and your incredible ability to cut to the core of every matter. This is just a phase and you're able to work through it.
 ----- 
 There's an extra bit of fire in your words and emotions today, Cancer. Your sensitivity is heightened and you should consider doing some sort of volunteer work now. You may talk about saving the world, but talk will get you nowhere until you put those ideas into practice. Take part in the lives of people who are less fortunate and seek the truth in all the issues you encounter.
 ----- 
 There may be serious challenges in your daily routine today, Leo. How can you organize your day more efficiently? Take time to set a plan into motion. Write it down. You may want to drift into another realm, so let those emotions roam free 
 ----- 
 You may feel idealistic today, Virgo. This is fine, but make sure these ideals are rooted in reality or they may be nothing more than a pipe dream. Feel free to escape to another mindset, but make sure you can still discern what's real and what isn't. This is a formative time for you in which you realize that the conventional ways of doing things aren't working anymore. Spread the word.
 ----- 
 Your dreams and fantasies are more real than you know, Libra. Smile at the people you pass and watch them smile back. Your sensitive and fun
 ----- 
 Your sensitivity is especially heightened today, Scorpio. You're in tune with your emotions and more sensitive to your dreams. Realize the importance of friendship and show someone you care by initiating an outing or intimate dinner at your home. You have greater self
 ----- 
 You may be going through a confusing period now, Sagittarius. Today's energy brings these issues into focus. Parts of your life seem to be slapping you in the face, indicating that a drastic life change is coming. Resist the urge to play the victim and let other people grab the reins simply because they act more confidently. This is your life and only you know what's best for you.
 ----- 
 Spiritual concerns and fanciful daydreams move into sharp focus today, Capricorn. Perhaps you're pulled by playful emotions and escapism. Keep one foot on the ground while you send your mind into the clouds, but definitely take time to check the air up there and report your findings to your conscious self. You may feel a greater sensitivity toward others now while your intuition is strong.
 ----- 
 Have you taken someone for granted lately? Today you should give them the thanks and attention they deserve, Aquarius. Your sensitivity and psychic awareness are especially strong. You aren't in the mood to put up with superficialities. Stick with what is real and say it like it is. Tension in your daily life may surface, but if you have things under control, you will ride through it just fine.
 ----- 
 There may be some serious miscommunication today, so be honest in all your dealings, Pisces. Be as straightforward as possible, since issues can backfire if the truth is clouded. Honesty is invaluable and must be maintained at all times. You have the power to make a lasting impression on people. Curb your tendency to snap at others. Watch out for accidents involving fire or metal.
 ----- 
 Close relationships should grow closer today, and new relationships become close ones. You're likely to feel extremely warm and loving toward most of the people you know, and they should reciprocate that feeling. Romantic relationships, especially, could grow more intimate and physical. You like the way you feel, Aries, but want to express it outwardly through gifts or intimacy.
 ----- 
 Relations with family or other members of your household should be especially warm now. Mutual goals and shared wins and losses are likely to bring you closer. Communication with friends and other acquaintances should be open and honest without being blunt, Taurus, providing you with a rewarding day. You probably won't spend much of your day alone. Make the most of it.
 ----- 
 You should feel loving today toward just about anyone you like and respect. Clear communication with friends, lovers, and children could enhance your understanding of them, and vice versa. The bonds in these relationships will be strengthened, perpetuating the good feelings you've felt all year. Current bonds grow more devoted, while new ones become close. Keep the lines of communication open.
 ----- 
 Powerful feelings of love well up today, particularly toward family members. Communication between you and those you love is likely to be heightened, Cancer, as you learn to speak your mind while not being too blunt. Romantic matters could thrive now, as you will be in the mood to physically express your feelings. Old friends form stronger bonds, while you discover common interests with new friends.
 ----- 
 Messages from close friends expressing their love and admiration for you may seem to arrive out of the blue. Your accomplishments over the past few weeks may have caused them to see you in a new light. Today you will experience the full force of their feelings. The doors of communication are open for you. You could decide to spend the day getting to know your friends all over again.
 ----- 
 You're always one to face things logically, Virgo, and today you turn that logic, along with your intuition, toward reassessing some of your values. Your judgment is especially acute, so any decisions you make or any new avenues you want to explore are likely to be just what you need now. Relations with friends, lovers, and family should be warm, loving, and close.
 ----- 
 You're likely to feel especially friendly and outgoing today, Libra. People you meet, particularly through groups, are likely to be strongly attracted to you. Friendships, partnerships, and romantic relationships should continue to grow closer, enhanced by your high level of communication. In the evening, go out with those you love. Your bond will be stronger for it.
 ----- 
 You should be in a warm and romantic mood today, Scorpio. You will want to schedule an intimate evening with your partner, but you probably won't feel like staying in. You desire an evening out, perhaps to a restaurant, concert, or play. Regardless of how you usually feel, tonight you won't have any reservations about showing affection in public. Enjoy your evening.
 ----- 
 The mutual exploration of spiritual and intellectual ideas could bring you closer to friends and lovers. Fascinating discussions open new horizons to all participants. You may be overcome by the strong feeling of unity. By day's end, you could experience a strong spiritual longing to study whatever the topic of conversation was. Don't hesitate. It can only help you grow.
 ----- 
 You feel especially sexy right now. A powerful feeling of love and a need to physically express it could be with you all day. If you're involved, you want to spend a romantic evening with your lover. If you aren't, you could channel the energy into creative activities. Romantic novels and movies are poor substitutes for the real thing, Capricorn, but if they're all that's available, go for it.
 ----- 
 Close relationships could lead to a feeling of spiritual unity today. In fact, Aquarius, you might feel as if those who share your interests are actually your family now. If you're involved, expect to experience warm and passionate feelings toward your partner. If not, don't be surprised if someone new comes on the scene. Shared intellectual interests might be what bring you together.
 ----- 
 Love, sex, and romance are on your mind today, Pisces, so you will want to spend as much time as possible with your lover. You could also grow closer to your friends, resulting in a powerful feeling of unity. Right now you have the gift of being able to exercise good judgment when it comes to values in life. If decisions need to be made along this line, this is the time to make them.
 ----- 
 The morning might find you sitting like a stick in the mud, Aries. People might be getting down on you for not contributing, but tell them to be patient. You will be raring to go by nightfall. The catalyst may come from an outside source. Be on the lookout for a challenge. Someone might rattle your cage a bit too much, so be patient and don't take it personally.
 ----- 
 Things are moving your way, Taurus. As the day progresses, you will find that the energy intensifies. Conflicts may arise near sundown, but don't worry about it too much. See it as a call to jump
 ----- 
 You should enjoy the intense energy of today, Gemini. The mud is finally beginning to clear away. Expose the truth in every issue and get ready for the gremlins that may be unEarthed. Connect with nature today and spend some time with animals if you can. Take deep breaths in fresh outdoor air and enjoy a long walk somewhere special with a close friend.
 ----- 
 Today marks the beginning of a new cycle for you, Cancer. Collect and consolidate your recent ideas and focus them outwardly. The time is right for you to act. Improve your surroundings and adjust your bed so that it faces east/west. (A north/south placement aligns you with Earth's magnetic field and causes you to lose energy at night.) Drink plenty of water to keep your mind clear.
 ----- 
 Take a cold shower to jump
 ----- 
 Today may start out sluggish for you, Virgo, but by the end of the day the energy will move fast and furious. Your thoughts will be buzzing around your head like bees around a hive. An introspective and contemplative morning has filled your brain with a new wave of thoughts, which you will be eager to share with anything that has ears tonight.
 ----- 
 Enjoy the calm morning, Libra, because things are going to get crazier and more energetic as the day goes on. Emotions will run high, and people will be more opinionated than usual. A conflict may arise from which you just want to extricate yourself. Realize that a more peaceful agreement will ensue if you jump in and add your two cents' worth.
 ----- 
 You will experience an intense amount of energy today, Scorpio. Your dream state will be more active than usual, and you will find that people are drawn to you like moths to light.

 ----- 
 It's time to get up and get moving, Sagittarius. You have tremendous ideas and vision for the future. You have all the information you need. Now all you have to do is act. Step up to the plate and hit one over the fence. Getting out of your box and further into the world at large will do you a great deal of good. Get a greater perspective on things and enjoy time in a new environment.
 ----- 
 The early part of the day might find you sluggish and indecisive, Capricorn, but later you should be psyched up and ready to go. Today marks the beginning of a new period in which you should set your ideas in motion. Action is the key. Think before you speak and use caution when talking about other people. Make sure your discussions about others don't turn into gossip.
 ----- 
 Today's energies will get progressively more intense as the day goes on. In the morning, you may be in an easygoing, dreamy state, Aquarius, but you will be itching to take action by nightfall. Take what you've learned from your sensitive, meditative state and share it with others. Use your inner calm to bring stability to stressful situations. Make sure things don't get out of hand tonight.
 ----- 
 For the past several weeks you've felt like you've been dragging your heels, Pisces. Decisions may have been hard to make and people may have seemed wishy
 ----- 
 You're going through a time of great preparation right now, Aries, You're building the foundation for a major life project. This period isn't to be taken lightly. The day's energy brings this importance into focus. Make sure you're building with bricks and not straw, and that the mortar you use is strong. Try not to get discouraged by negative emotions. The situation is probably better than it seems.
 ----- 
 There's a sober feeling to the day that may leave you feeling a bit down, Taurus. There may not be any specific instance or situation that causes you to feel this way, so don't sweat it. Focus on getting your projects done. This isn't the best day to look for sympathy from others. Crank up your stereo as loud as you can and indulge in a scrumptious meal.
 ----- 
 People may be extra stubborn today, so try to avoid any confrontations that could lead to full
 ----- 
 Your freedom
 ----- 
 Today is a great day to get rid of the stuff that's cluttering up your life, Leo. Get to the heart of the issue and stop beating around the bush. Your emotions may feel a bit more negative than usual, but realize that you can use this to your advantage. Your sober attitude can aid in making extremely practical, well
 ----- 
 Don't sweat the small stuff, Virgo. You may feel like something is restricting your otherwise light, witty nature, but don't worry about it. Things probably seem worse than they really are. Trust in yourself. Relations with others may not be at their best, and it may seem like your feelings are being squeezed through the ringer. Keep your chin up and work to get things done right the first time.
 ----- 
 There are opportunities open to you now whether you realize it or not. It may be hard to be aware of them today, given the astrological weather. Your emotions may feel restricted and weighed down, like something is trying to tie you down. Realize that this is just a message from the Universe reminding you that having at least one foot on the ground is key to manifesting your dreams.
 ----- 
 Your emotions may feel restricted today, Scorpio. You may feel bad about something you did in the past. Somehow your heart isn't able to let it go. Work to overcome this by realizing that this is only a briefly passing trend and that you probably are feeling much worse about the situation than necessary. Don't be so hard on yourself.
 ----- 
 You're going through a period of major evaluation and assessment of certain life projects. Today's energies bring much of that tension into focus, Sagittarius, and put it right in the place where it affects you most 
 ----- 
 Try to stay disciplined and focused today, Capricorn. This may be easier said than done, but it's crucial for preserving your sanity.

Instead of getting down on yourself, use this energy to your advantage and make order out of the chaos in your life. Eat a healthy meal and share your thoughts with others.
 ----- 
 You're going through a time in which you have the opportunity to make tremendous advances, Aquarius. These rewards won't come without hard work and discipline, however, and this seems to be a focus of the day. Get your emotions in line and make the best of what seems to be a pretty dreary situation. A fantastic opportunity is at hand.
 ----- 
 Don't mess with superiors or people in authority today, Pisces, or you might end up in some serious hot water. Take it easy and try not get bogged down by negative emotions. Things may not be as sunny as usual, but that doesn't mean the day will be terrible. Complete projects and stay focused on things that require a great deal of discipline on your part.
 ----- 
 Today is a great day to check off all the items on that list of yours, Aries. Get it done. At the same time, realize that your emotions might be a bit clouded and that things that seem genuine may actually be just a mirage. Issues of a spiritual nature are of primary concern. You should make sure you're nurturing this side of your being. Think with your heart.
 ----- 
 Today is a great day to let your artistic nature shine through, Taurus. Your sense of color and pattern is right on target and your words are more poetic than usual. Create a time and space for your creative inner nature to manifest on the physical plane. Let your fantasy world spill onto a piece of paper for others to see. You have tremendous gifts. Feel free to share them with the world.
 ----- 
 Your emotions may be confused today, Gemini. People may seem to rub you the wrong way, and you may feel like you're all alone in the world. Keep in mind that you're very sensitive and capable of picking up things that other people miss. You cut through the masks and see right to the core of every issue. Give yourself credit for being a passionate detective.
 ----- 
 You may be out of step with the rest of the world today, Cancer, but don't sweat it. This is a good day to finish projects. Your head may be in the clouds and your emotions foggier than usual. Bring more of your fantasy world to the current reality. Don't just talk about lofty ideas and beautiful dreams 
 ----- 
 Stay grounded and focused today, Leo, You can accomplish a lot if you set your mind to it. You may sense a blurry cloud lingering 
 ----- 
 Today's events may cause disruption in your routine, Virgo. Your emotions may seem clouded, and other people may challenge aspects of your ego. Relationships with the opposite sex may not be great today, so don't try to force an issue that you know will end up in conflict. There's an air of conservatism throughout the day that may not pair well with your unconventional nature. Lay low.
 ----- 
 Turn up your fantasy dial and let your imagination run wild. Your intuition is strong today, Libra, and you should give your emotions room to flow. Work to clear the blockages that keep you from doing things you truly want to do. Get your ideas on paper and manifest more of your fantasy world in reality. People may be stingy, so now isn't the best time to ask for a raise or loan.
 ----- 
 Issues may be clouded today, Scorpio. The things that seem real may actually be illusions. You might find that you feel a bit more reserved than usual and that you want to hold tight to your material possessions for comfort. Keep in mind that other people are extremely important to you now and you would benefit greatly by offering your hand to those who are less fortunate.
 ----- 
 Terrific energy flows your way today, Sagittarius. Make sure that what you're dealing with is genuine. There's a tendency for people to get lost in their fantasy worlds. Be aware that what seems practical today could be the opposite tomorrow. Your emotions may seem confused, but if you concentrate on releasing instead of judging them, you can sail through the day without any trouble.
 ----- 
 The heaviness of the day weighs on you, Capricorn. Take your time with projects and carefully evaluate all the facts before making a decision. People can be deceptive, so be careful in all your dealings. You may be going through a period in which you care less about material possessions and concern yourself with spiritual things. This is a great time to delve into the occult.
 ----- 
 Your fantasy world is especially piqued today, Aquarius. Your need to escape physical reality is strong. Be careful about how you go about this. Dreams may take you there, but be rational so you aren't left more confused than before. Keep your energy pure and clean. Other people will recognize you for your tender, sensitive nature, so feel free to be confident with your words.
 ----- 
 People may tug at you from all sides today, Pisces. No matter which way you turn, someone is there. Be patient and levelheaded. Your time will come. For now, look at these challenges as lessons for the future and learn from them. Your point of view isn't the only one in the world. It would probably be a good thing if you worked on incorporating other people's opinions into your own.
 ----- 
 Attend to your duties today, Aries. There's a pronounced sense of time and a feeling that the days are slipping away. Make sure you fit love and romance into the equation somewhere. At first you may experience a bit of resistance in this department, but see that as an indication that this is an area of your life that you need to explore and ultimately feel more comfortable with.
 ----- 
 Two different sides may tug on you today, and neither one may really make a strong case for pulling you one way or the other, Taurus. Realize that adjustments may have to be made for you to fit in with the scheme of things and fulfill your duties and responsibilities. A close loved one may distract you in subtle ways, so try not to get sidetracked if you can help it.
 ----- 
 Tension may be a bit high with everyone and everything you encounter today, Gemini. There will be a strong need for stability and discipline, while others call for fun and frivolity. You may be caught in the middle. The worst thing is that no side, including yours, is going to want to compromise. Try not to take things too seriously.
 ----- 
 Remember that you're here to have fun, and happiness is your true destiny, Cancer. Keep this in mind today, as forces may tend to pull you away from the fun you've been having. There may be a rather sobering tone to the day that's stubbornly trying to rain on your parade. Recognize the need for structure and stability, but don't let it bring you down.
 ----- 
 You will recognize and appreciate the need for structure and stability on a day like today, Leo. This practical energy may work to take away some of the fun out of the equation. You may not realize it, but the fun in your life may be getting chipped away little by little. Hold tight to the things that give you passion and purpose in life. These are the keys to healthy living.
 ----- 
 Tension may build today if you aren't careful about how you use your words, Virgo. Remember that forces are trying to push you one way and pull you another. You may encourage a focus on the collective while others seem too worried about themselves. Yet another force is calling for outdated remedies and traditional structures that no longer suit your purposes. Blaze your own trail.
 ----- 
 Take a look at what's going on around you today, Libra, and do some internal processing before you reach a conclusion regarding the best way to proceed. You may find that a combination of powerful forces is trying to win you over to their camp. Don't pigeonhole yourself into one way of doing things. Keep in mind that the best route is often a combination of several different paths.
 ----- 
 Watch out for a jolt in the action, Scorpio, as someone close to you puts on the brakes in a relationship. There could be conflicts based on a need for more structure and stability in the partnership. The imbalance between having fun and taking care of practical matters is currently working to slowly destroy the good thing that you have going. Nip this problem in the bud.
 ----- 
 Just when you thought you had everything planned and working smoothly, Sagittarius, love comes in and clogs up the works. Suddenly your attention is diverted from work as the love of your life catches your eye. This could be a good or bad thing, depending on how you view it. Remember that both aspects of your life are important. The key now is to find a healthy balance between the two.
 ----- 
 Your heart is going pitter
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit of a strain today as you try to figure out the best way to get to where you need to be, Aquarius. The happy, jovial approach tells you to let loose, be courageous, and strike out with conviction toward the things that mean the most to you. A sense of duty and restriction may be holding you back. Take the best of both worlds and come up with a unique plan of attack.
 ----- 
 Your romantic side is powerfully charged today, Pisces. The more you tune in to this side of your nature, the happier you will be. The one thing to watch out for is keeping at least one foot on the ground at all times. Work from a stable platform of honesty and practicality. Without this foundation, you will be hard pressed to establish any walls or windows.
 ----- 
 Don't go where you aren't invited and don't take things that aren't offered, Aries. Rules and manners are the cornerstones to healthy friendships and strong bonds among new acquaintances on a day like today. You will find that a cheery attitude and pleasant smile go a long way. Before you know it, you will be invited everywhere and offered all the things you desire.
 ----- 
 Let your true personality shine, Taurus, for this is your day to radiate. There's an element of fantasy and deception working in the equation, but you will find that this may be just the thing you're looking for. The missing piece may come from a place you least expect, but be confident that it will come. Be open to new ideas and information, regardless of how odd they seem.
 ----- 
 Realize that to conquer new ground you may have to make some sacrifices, Gemini. Things may not always go according to your perfect vision, but that's the natural way of things. Life should be simple and free flowing. The tangle of voices in your mind is usually the thing that makes issues and situations more complicated than they need to be. Maintain the peace and keep things easy.
 ----- 
 There's a great deal of air to fuel your fire today, Cancer. Conversations will light up upon your arrival. Dreams, fantasies, and inspired wishes may come to the surface, asking you to digest them with your open, adventurous mind. Use this fuel to keep things burning red hot within you. Bring your dreams to the surface and turn them into realities by joining forces with others.
 ----- 
 Although you may want to bring things down a bit so you can better plan, organize, and rearrange, Leo, this may not be the best course of action today. You're better off keeping things light and uplifting. Things will fall into place as you need them. Trust in others. Realize that some of the best experiences you will have in life are spontaneous. Put your to
 ----- 
 Join others for stimulating conversation and purposeful dreaming, Virgo. You aren't alone in your thoughts and strong opinions. Now is the time to be heard. Work toward maintaining peace by exposing truth. Take the time to create fantasy in your world by diluting the fears of reality. Make decisions based on love, cooperation, and prosperity instead of neediness, trepidation, and anger.
 ----- 
 It's time to come up for air, Libra. Come out and take a deep breath. Experience the lightness and rejuvenation of the energy present in the air around you. Do some yoga or go for a jog to open up your channels and get your circulation moving. Use this exercise to clear your mind and open your consciousness to let new ideas and dreams be born from within.
 ----- 
 Take a step back today, Scorpio, and sink into a light and dreamy fantasy world that is pleasing to you. You will find that beautiful objects and sweet fragrances catch your attention. Go shopping or indulge in a gourmet meal. The time is right to keep things open and social. Have fun and focus on your partnerships with others instead of your tendency to lead or dominate.
 ----- 
 Things might be too elusive to actually grab hold of today, Sagittarius. Don't be so concerned with capturing something and making it your own. See the beauty around you and hold it in your heart. Leave the flower unpicked so others who come after you can enjoy its splendor as well. There's an airy, uplifting feeling to the day that you should enjoy.
 ----- 
 This is a terrific day for you, Capricorn. You should find that the puzzle pieces naturally come together almost effortlessly. Important connections can be made today as long as you keep all the lines of communication open. Information exchange is a key part of bringing people and ideas together in a constructive manner. A burst of inspiration can lead to a rewarding journey through time and space.
 ----- 
 There's a stronger connectedness to dreams and fantasies today, Aquarius, but you may need to adjust your thinking in order to link to it. Pick a path that includes a few steps on the sunny side of the street where you can see things in a positive light instead of focusing on the gloom in every situation. Communicate your thoughts and think about how you can promote peace in your inner circle.
 ----- 
 There's a warm and friendly feeling to the day that you will find agreeable to your boisterous personality, Pisces. Find strength and peace with the people around you and work to make solid connections among your friends. The people around you are your greatest resource, so treat them with honor and respect. Stay in balance by recognizing the strength in others.
 ----- 
 Issues regarding love and romance should be going well for you now, Aries. You will find that your natural tendency to ground and plan is working perfectly with your desire to find what you want in a mate. Things may be about to come to a dramatic climax in your emotional realm. A foggy, dreamy feeling may make it difficult for you to keep your feet on the ground.
 ----- 
 You may want to escape into your dreams today, Taurus. Trying to do something practical may be met with opposition, as the general mood of the day calls for things to be more ethereal and elusive. Connect with your sensitive side and feel free to spend time on artistic projects. You may have to take a more grounded approach when it comes to matters of love.
 ----- 
 You will be able to find a greater connection to your inner soul today, Gemini. You will also find that you're more psychic than usual. Trust your intuition. The more you look inward, the more you're apt to find the solutions to your outward questions. Combine a sense of dreamy emotion with a grounded feeling of love and beauty. You may need to balance your cloudy head with stable roots.
 ----- 
 You may have many irons in the fire today, Cancer. People and projects could demand your attention, yet you may feel so dreamy and unmotivated that it could be hard to make progress on any of them. Creative solutions are the best route for you. Be flexible and open to other people's ideas, and make sure you consider the unlikeliest ways to tackle the issues.
 ----- 
 This is going to be a great day for you, Leo. Strangely enough, you will find that tension may help you get things done. There's an easiness today that will create openings for exploring creative outlets. Regarding love and romance, try to stay grounded. You and the object of your desire may have two different points of view on the relationship. Communicate clearly.
 ----- 
 You may need to let go and release your control, Virgo. You know what you want, so just trust your intuition. If you continue to let your brain do all the work, you will probably miss valuable information that can only come when you slow down and look within. Connect with others on sensitive issues and feel free to let your guard down. Let your mind work freely.
 ----- 
 This is an excellent day for you, Libra. You will find that things automatically flow your way. You will receive more attention than usual and be the center of any flattering discussions. The one difficult point might be intimate relations with others. Romantic issues may take on a more serious, grounded tone at this time.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit lazy and unmotivated today, Scorpio. It could be hard to drag yourself out of bed. In terms of love and romance, there's apt to be some tension, as one part of you wants to make plans while another part is feeling up in the air and in the clouds. These two different viewpoints might make it difficult to make a move in any one direction.
 ----- 
 Love and romance are apt to be going quite well for you now, Sagittarius. You should find that it's easier to be yourself in a partnership. Let your romantic side shine through. Indulge in delicious candlelit dinners and share your deepest fantasies with those you love. If your partner resists this energy now, you may want to consider looking elsewhere for romantic company.
 ----- 
 You may feel a great deal of nervous energy today, Capricorn. Tension could come to you from all angles. Indecisiveness might be your biggest problem. You may be in a frenzy trying to figure out where to move next. The key is to slow down and relax. Don't make a move without evaluating things. Be careful about acting too hastily, especially when it comes to matters of the heart.
 ----- 
 Issues having to do with love and romance are in your favor today, Aquarius. You're more in touch with your emotions. You will find that your attitude toward love is more grounded than usual. Feel free to let go of some control. Let fate take you where it will in this department. Also make sure that you don't worry so much about things. Worrying will cause doubt, something you don't need.
 ----- 
 You may not feel in sync with the day's energy, Pisces. Something about it may not sit right with you. Your natural instinct to want to take the lead may be overshadowed by an unwillingness to even get up. You may feel like your internal fire is squelched, especially when it comes to love and beauty. If your mind is cloudy, don't worry about it. The fog will clear soon.
 ----- 
 Intense emotions are apt to dominate the scene today, Aries. Don't do anything halfway. It's time to give it your all or nothing. You have the power to cut to the heart of the issue. Don't hesitate. If you meet opposition, stay strong. There's a valuable lesson to be learned. If you're being true to yourself, you should have no trouble overcoming any obstacle that stands in your path.
 ----- 
 There's an overwhelming intensity about the day that might make it difficult for you to maintain the peace, Taurus. Strong opinions and courageous emotions are clashing in a climactic fashion. You might find yourself in the middle of conflicting forces if you aren't careful. Make sure you take care of yourself and your needs before you try to patch up things for everybody else.
 ----- 
 You may feel extra self
 ----- 
 You might find that others' strong opinions dictate today's actions, Cancer. The atmosphere is quite intense, so you might want to lay low and let others have their way. Don't try to put up a fight. Unexpected opposition may come out of nowhere and take control. There's a powerful force at work asking you to do things with more passion than usual.
 ----- 
 Create your own reality, Leo. It could be that you have the puppet strings in your hands, but you're too afraid to use them. Don't shy away from responsibility. Take your time and don't lose sight of your goals. The stakes are extra high today, and you will find that the slightest movement is magnified several times over. Be careful how you use your words. They won't be taken lightly.
 ----- 
 Things that you thought were obvious may not seem quite as clear as you'd like them to be, Virgo. Be aware that there may be some intense opposition to your plans. Take care of other people and their emotions. You will find that a wall might suddenly go up, putting a harsh barrier between you and your goals. Consider your heart as well as your head.
 ----- 
 Other people may tend to snap under the emotional pressure of the day, Libra, but you're well suited to soar through with flying colors. You're ruled by your emotions and you have no problem navigating rough waters. Other people may look to you for strength and support. Trust yourself and try not to get lured off course by conflicting opinions that don't seem to sit right with you.
 ----- 
 There's a need for decisive action today, Scorpio, and you're the one fit for the job. Strong wills and forceful opinions will win out. Others aren't likely to be easily manipulated. Everyone has a voice, and they won't be afraid to use it. Make sure that you speak up on your behalf or your best interests may be lost. Stand up for yourself. It's now or never.
 ----- 
 There may be tension and opposition today, Sagittarius, so be prepared. It could seem like everyone wants to rattle your cage. Stand strong. There are forceful opinions crying out to be heard. The more stubborn you are, the harder it will be for important information to flow freely. Protect your interests by standing your ground, but make sure you don't step on other people's toes in the process.
 ----- 
 What ails you now can be eliminated if you're willing to stand up and say exactly what needs to be said, Capricorn. Going with the flow may be an easy route to follow, but it might not always take you down a path that leads to the fulfillment of your dreams. Be a bit more aggressive about your position today and outwardly project yourself as the true master of your destiny.
 ----- 
 It takes two to tango, Aquarius. Remember that life isn't a one
 ----- 
 It may be hard to resolve anything today, Pisces. It could be that there's an overwhelming resistance making it difficult to act according to plan. Today isn't a good day to fight. If things don't seem to be going your way, don't push it. Trying to strong
 ----- 
 You are very interested in all kinds of professions that concern humans, Aries 
 ----- 
 You may surprise the people around you over the next few days, Taurus. You're a responsible person and others can count on you. But just like anybody else, you're sensitive to your desires. You should expect your desires to be so strong today that they may be irresistible. If this is a positive experience, you may need to do some planning in your personal life.
 ----- 
 You may have to stand by certain difficult, worrisome decisions today, Gemini. You may feel a kind of urgent need for stability in your personal life. What is really behind this feeling? Is it possible that you're just afraid of your desire to put everything into question in order to make a fresh start? Today you may find the answer to this question. Stay tuned.
 ----- 
 Do you help the world evolve, Cancer? You may ask yourself this kind of delicate question today. Even if you're a person of action who knows how to react to situations, you should be careful not to be too impulsive. You have a specific role to play. Don't get thrown off track by emotional circumstances.
 ----- 
 You may tend to be overprotective of the people closest to you, especially children. You may feel you live in a dangerous world in which people don't care about responsibility to one another. But the people you're trying to protect are probably better prepared and adapted to the world than you think, Leo. They might try to tell you this even if your support is indispensable.
 ----- 
 You probably need society's or other people's approval in order to feel good about yourself, Virgo. But your original personality and way of thinking are often hard for others to accept. You may need to make your ideas less crazy and a little more down to Earth and practical. This should be your goal over the next few days if you don't want to feel left out of things.
 ----- 
 The events of the day depend on your ability to put things into question today, Libra. In general, you're good at analyzing situations when things aren't going well in your relationships. Now someone in your family may have a problem acting responsibly. It's up to that person to take care of things, but you could understand the message the person is trying to send other people with his or her behavior.
 ----- 
 The planetary aspects are going to have a big impact on you today, Scorpio. This isn't the time to fear the future. Rather, it's a time to make it happen. The action you take right now will be instrumental in your future. Will there be enough of us walking toward the future? Scorpio will be at the head of the pack in any case, as always.
 ----- 
 People are more alike than we think, especially on days like today that mean virtually the same thing to everyone. Some incredible changes have taken place in the world and its economic and social systems. Now is the time to think about what the next few years have in store. Do you have any ideas? Try to articulate them.
 ----- 
 Today is an inspirational day for you, fast thinking Capricorn. Let those visions come to you, process them, and try to verbalize them. A lot of information and electricity is in the air, and you should have no problem picking up on it. Open up your channels for the best reception. Have a notepad handy to jot down all your insights.
 ----- 
 You're usually good at bringing people together. Your greatest strength is giving identity to those people who seek it. In fact, you're so aware of the differences between people that you resist the changes that come about as people evolve. Today's planetary alignment confronts you with issues that concern your future. Your position will help you accept things and go forward.
 ----- 
 Some of you still let individuals from other Zodiac signs do all the creating for you. The planetary configuration today pushes you to free yourself from the ties that bind you. It's time for you to show more creativity. Show the gems that you usually hide. Express yourself fully, without hesitation. Show others who's really in charge.
 ----- 
 Today you may get the opportunity to feel proud of yourself. But don't let things get too out of hand. It isn't often that you allow yourself this little bit of narcissism. Everything you say will be pertinent, and people will let you know. For once, the stars are giving you the opportunity to cater to your own ego, so take advantage of it!
 ----- 
 Today you may be overcome by a current of humanist thought, Taurus. Your consciousness is traveling, and you probably couldn't care less about the details of the events going on around you. You're freethinking, which is inspired by your spirit of fairness. You may even be in a situation where you have to act as a kind of "enlightened" referee, which you will only be too happy to do!
 ----- 
 Even if you're a good judge of character, Gemini, the people who know you say that you base your opinions on your personal feelings, which often affect your good judgment. Today your critics are wrong, and your judgments are as precise and objective as they can possibly be. They may even help you out of a sticky situation.
 ----- 
 You tend to want to explain everything that goes on around you, Cancer. You rationalize everything in an instant, and group all your experiences into great theories. But you've been very quiet for quite some time now. It's as if something is keeping you from speaking. Today you will get a few words in, so don't worry.
 ----- 
 As a Leo, you don't really like to talk about things. Talking just isn't one of your specialties. Everyone has his/her own role, and yours is to take action and create, not talk about doing it. However, the planetary positions today might make you utter a few very deep words. Come on! Tell us a little something about how you feel deep inside!
 ----- 
 Scientists seem to live in a world apart from the rest of us, Virgo, and from the events in everyday life, because they're so absorbed in other realities. This is a lot like your universe. If you were a scientist, you might do what they sometimes do 
 ----- 
 You're often like a Zen master who doesn't say anything to pupils for months, until the day the pupils begin to not believe any more and find themselves growing indifferent to the whole thing. Then the master pronounces one or two phrases that are so incredibly true that no one knows what to say! You could be that Zen master today.
 ----- 
 It's time to take some time out of your busy day for your personal life, Scorpio. One of your family members or friends may need to talk to you, and you need to listen attentively to what they have to say. You need to use all your wonderful energy to get down to the heart of the matter. Who knows? You may discover some hidden treasures along the way.
 ----- 
 Today is a good day to clarify your life, Sagittarius. You may have understood lately that it's useless to undertake anything new when you're confused. You've figured out that all it takes to get out of that state is to take care of yourself, eat better, get more sleep, or take a vacation. Your mind will be sufficiently rested today to deal with all the problems that come your way.
 ----- 
 Are you going to be available to other people today? Someone in your entourage may need to confide in you. If the superficiality of the exchange bothers you, you will understand what the atmosphere of today is all about! Yes, you're available, but not for just anything. You're in no mood to waste time at the moment.
 ----- 
 You may come in contact with someone today with whom you enjoy a highly emotional exchange. You may even fall in love! Be very attentive to your moods and everything going on inside you, Aquarius. They will be particularly strong, and they will help you understand what is changing in you. Just be careful to distinguish your feelings from those of your (future?) partner.
 ----- 
 It's possible that you're having some ups and downs in your love life at the moment. Someone may be asking you to play another role than you're used to playing in your relationship. Today, Pisces, you should take the time to think about these pressures on you. You're going to need the answers to these questions over the next few months.
 ----- 
 What a great day for you! You seem to have the innate listening abilities of a therapist or counselor. Everyone comes to you with their problems or to cry on your proverbial shoulder. They know that you will listen without judgment. Have you ever thought about doing something like this for a living? Perhaps today will make you think about it.
 ----- 
 If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. This is your maxim for the day, Taurus. What have you done lately to improve the way you live your life? Would you consider taking off on some wild adventure without looking back? Today you may meet some people who will make you want to. They're adventurers looking for thrills and chills, with all the risks that come along with them.
 ----- 
 Strength of character will be your partner today, Gemini. You seem to have an aura whose intensity scares some people and attracts others. Your force of character could be the cause of some wonderful feelings and emotions for the people close to you. Don't try and hide your emotions. They're the source of your creativity.
 ----- 
 What an extraordinary day for you, Cancer! The dynamic energy in the air will help you set new personal goals. The positive feedback you get from the people around you could inspire you to make some life
 ----- 
 You can start your day without all the usual planning. Be free to discover your day as it unfolds. This might feel like it's against your nature, but it's good for you to enjoy life's sometimes arbitrary nature every once in a while. Otherwise, you may miss out on some of the best things life has to offer!
 ----- 
 In general, you tend to be critical of the way the government and politicians handle social issues and institutions. Your goal isn't just to criticize, however. You would also like to see some positive changes in these areas. The aura of understanding and comprehension in the air today helps you realize that if you want the world to evolve, you're going to have to get people to react.
 ----- 
 Libra, you may have felt as if something has been changing in your family environment over the last few weeks. Today you will find out what's been going on. Someone close to you has been going through some important changes in his or her life. You feel as if you need to be there and accompany this person on a journey of self
 ----- 
 You tend to think of yourself as a lone warrior, Scorpio. Today your efforts over the last few weeks pay off. You've found your place in a group of people. You may even call it a family. You now have a place to come home to, whether it's to celebrate your victories or lick your wounds. If you could just open up to other people, you'd soon find that you have more than one safe haven.
 ----- 
 You love the creative process, Sagittarius. Even watering your plants or painting a picture will give you a feeling of joy. If this month you get a chance to finish a project that you really care about, you will be satisfied with the results. And you will be surprised to see people react positively. It's OK to be proud of yourself.
 ----- 
 Capricorn, your lighthearted attitude has given you a reputation as an eternal teenager. But levity is also a sign of a very wise person, a person who knows how to laugh at their wisdom. Whether you realize it or not, you can get involved in a serious relationship without losing your lightheartedness. If you're already in a committed relationship, you know how true this is.
 ----- 
 What changes have there been in your life since this time last year? Think about the events that have taken place. What have you accomplished? What decisions have you made? And most importantly, how much you have grown as a person? Try to make changes by following your intuition. Even though it seems stressful and sometimes painful, change means growth!
 ----- 
 It may be upsetting to you, Pisces, but there's something you need to think about. You should finally get it through your head that the people you often call "brilliant" are only reflections of you. If this month you decide to have a little faith in yourself and assert yourself a little, you could be in for some very nice surprises! You'll see!
 ----- 
 You will fit in perfectly with just about every situation you encounter today, Aries. Things are going well for you, so take advantage of the energy. You will find that you can accomplish a lot with very little effort. Other people will respect that. If something needs to be done meticulously and efficiently, you're the one for the job.
 ----- 
 Don't expect a reaction from people today even if you tell the funniest jokes. Others are likely to be reserved and uptight. For the most part, the day's forecast calls for conservative skies and a slight chance of grumpiness. The best way to handle this is to engage in activities that require discipline, grounding, and efficiency. Finish your chores and plan fun things for evening.
 ----- 
 You will keep a level head today, Gemini, so take this opportunity to make rational decisions about the most intense issues on the table. Stay grounded and concentrate on what you need to do. Don't get caught up in the usual emotional drama. Restriction and limitation are main themes of the day that will help you reach your goals.
 ----- 
 Your playful attitude will be a welcome addition to the sober, restrictive tone of the day. On the other hand, it may behoove you to be serious in order to accomplish what you need to get done. The choice is up to you. However, you would probably be wise to spend this day taking care of chores and nagging errands that you've put off for quite some time.
 ----- 
 This is a terrific day for you, Leo. You will feel a greater sense of appreciation and respect for the people around you. The planning and hard work you've contributed recently is finally paying off. People are likely to arrive at your level of thinking. You'll find you can connect on a very productive level. Your emotions are under control and your thoughts crystal clear.
 ----- 
 There's a restrictive, sober tone to the day that may wear you down, Virgo. The trick to working this energy to your advantage is to adjust your game plan to fit the mood. Take care of mundane chores and small obstacles. Make realistic plans and follow through with short
 ----- 
 Come down from the clouds today, Libra. It's important to connect with what's going on down here. It could be that you're missing your target because you failed to take certain details into account that are obvious to everyone else. Attend to projects that require your attention. Realistic planning and disciplined actions are the best activities to engage in.
 ----- 
 There's a lethargic pace to the day that might leave you frustrated, Scorpio. It may seem as if things aren't progressing as quickly as you'd like. Don't be seduced by the idea that everything needs to get done sooner. Faster isn't necessarily better. Focus on quality and efficiency. Examine what could be considered wasteful action. Streamline your daily routine.
 ----- 
 This is a terrific day for you to accomplish a lot, Sagittarius. You may feel restricted in your emotions and unable to make certain deep
 ----- 
 Slow down a bit today and do some planning. There's a steady, grounded mood that will help bring your thoughts and actions down to Earth. The wind may not be filling your sails as much as you'd like, but you can use this to your advantage. The underlying reservation in people's attitudes and opinions will aid you quite a bit. Eliminate the fluff and concentrate on what's real.
 ----- 
 There's a call for you to focus on tangible items today, Aquarius. Your emotions may be a bit restricted, but you will find comfort in beautiful, luxurious surroundings. Don't be surprised if people are a bit more critical than usual. What they intend as helpful may come across as hurtful. Try to keep a positive spin on things or you may slip down a negative spiral of self
 ----- 
 Get your life in order today, Pisces. Shed the false persona you've been wearing and really look in the mirror. Make sure you like the person you see. This is a good day to put frivolity aside and concentrate on what you need to accomplish. Tend to your duties and plan wisely for the future. Store up your resources instead of squandering them all now.
 ----- 
 The hard work and detail
 ----- 
 You may not want to wander far from your bedroom today. That's fine. Take this opportunity to get things done around the house that make you feel like your energy is an important part of the atmosphere. Hang new pictures, read inspiring articles, and laugh at magazine cartoons that inspire your humorous side. Be soft and gentle with your words and actions. Just take it easy!
 ----- 
 Things are on the upswing for you today, Gemini. People are finally coming around to see things from your perspective. There's no need to doubt yourself. Look in the mirror and know that the person you see is capable of accomplishing anything. Your powerful emotions are your allies. Don't be afraid to let your heart speak up loudly and clearly, the way it wants to.
 ----- 
 Take a step back from the line of fire today and examine your position. You've made some bold moves and now it's time to pause and evaluate. Listen to others' reactions. Take the observations and comments to heart. Other people may see things about your situation that you don't. Don't get boxed in by narrow
 ----- 
 You may not feel like you're in tune with your situation today, Leo. Try not to get too pushy with your opinions about how things should be done. Honor other people's perspectives and approaches. It may be hard for others to commit to things the same way you do. Their methods may be different, but that doesn't mean they are necessarily any better or worse.
 ----- 
 Try not to be too competitive today, Virgo. The more you try to drive your point across, the more it will meet stubborn opposition. This is a better day to observe the situation. Emotions are running high, and people aren't necessarily acting rationally. It will do no good to try to reason with someone determined to fight. Save your ammunition for something else.
 ----- 
 Sink into a soft, gentle rhythm and you flow with everything around you, Libra. Ease your mind about any worries. Your subconscious knows the way. The key today is sensitivity and intuition 
 ----- 
 Now isn't the time to prove to people that you're the boss, Scorpio. They would surely become defensive. You're much better off taking a sensitive, nurturing approach on a day like today. Focus your fire internally and use it to drive your own engine. Don't run over anyone else in the process or try to run their engine for them.
 ----- 
 This is a favorable day for you to deal with intimate and sensitive issues, Sagittarius. You will be in comfortable situations that allow you to express what you believe. There's no need to hold back, because people will have a greater understanding of what it is you feel. You combine deep emotions with mental clarity and you're able to see through to the truth in other people's words.
 ----- 
 There's a very heavy atmosphere around you that might feel stifling, Capricorn. Situations are cropping up that urge you to think practically with regard to your emotions. You will find that things go much more smoothly if you slow down and think about a situation before you proceed. Make sure you consider all the choices and what their effects will be on other people.
 ----- 
 Just when you thought that the whole world was turning on you, Aquarius, things start to come back around. You will find that you don't need to hide. In fact, the more you let your true spirit emerge, the more allies you will gain. Your secret ambition to rule your world is becoming a much more attainable goal than you might have thought at first.
 ----- 
 The more you let your ego and fantasies swell today, Pisces, the more friction you will encounter. Others aren't going to be fooled, nor are they going to want to deal with frivolity. You might consider letting someone else take the lead while you focus more on your internal energy. Don't be surprised if you cry for no apparent reason. It's important that the tears come out.
 ----- 
 You have strong humanitarian instincts, Aries. You think of your fellow humans more than most. This, combined with your intuition and empathy, makes you well suited for the healing professions. If you've felt a bit disgruntled at work lately, it may be that you're in the wrong career. Consider training as a counselor or therapist. You would be good at it and help a lot of people.
 ----- 
 You've been more thoughtful lately and truer to yourself. This is due to your recent introspection. You really can change your life. All it takes is time and commitment. You've made great progress in your development. Continue on this path and you will wind up in a much better place. Keep your eye on the goal, but don't be so focused that you forget to enjoy the journey.
 ----- 
 You're feeling confident and more comfortable in your own skin than you have in a long time, Gemini. You're so accomplished, why are you the last one to acknowledge it? Try to look up from your desk long enough to socialize with friends and loved ones. You've been so focused on work that your relationships may have suffered a bit. Spend some quality time with those you care about, if possible.
 ----- 
 It's time to loosen up, Cancer. The planetary aspects bring a new cycle of tolerance and understanding your way. You could use a bit of both. Take baby steps as you introduce the kinder, gentler you to your friends and co
 ----- 
 Remember all those resolutions you made in the past? It's time to recommit to them. All signs indicate that you need to take better care of yourself. You've been so busy working that exercising has begun to feel like a luxury you can't afford. Actually, exercise and proper nutrition are luxuries you can't afford to ignore. You're burning the candle at both ends. Stop before you burn out completely!
 ----- 
 This is an auspicious time for you, Virgo. It gives you the energy and enthusiasm to make the necessary changes in your life. There is a lot of work to do, but you're up to it! First focus on your relationships. Your loved ones don't care about your professional successes. They want (and perhaps need) to spend more time with you. Do what you can to bring your life more into balance.
 ----- 
 You have tremendous creativity inside you, Libra. Have you begun to use some of it? This creative cycle will last for the next month or so. Don't let it pass without taking advantage of it. Use the other side of your brain for a change. Take up sketching, painting, or fiction writing. What you do is less important than doing something. The simple act of creation unlocks the brain.
 ----- 
 Get excited because this is going to be one great day! Everything will go your way. It will seem as if you simply can't lose. At work, team members look to you as the leader. At home, family members express gratitude and affection. You may be tempted to try this luck at the casino, but don't be impulsive. You're already a winner. You've earned this shining moment.
 ----- 
 This is a good day for quiet contemplation, Sagittarius. You may have worried about finances lately, but there's no longer any need to concern yourself. All signs indicate that your financial fortunes are about to change. You've been working hard and should reap some rewards. Today's aspects suggest that you will. Enjoy your newfound peace of mind, but don't go out and use the credit cards in celebration!
 ----- 
 Capricorn, you're bound to enjoy this day! It's full of possibilities and opportunities. It may begin routinely, but keep your eyes and ears open for hints of change. Your new adventure may come about in a mundane way. You might meet someone in line at the store who becomes a business partner. Or maybe you will meet a romantic interest at the ATM. Adventure is all around. Trust that you will find it!
 ----- 
 Forget about work for a change and focus instead on your love life! This is one area that can really use some attention. There's no sense waiting for your partner to do it. It's up to you. Why not book a romantic weekend? It will do wonders for your relationship and add spark just by anticipating the fun you will have. Your commitment should mean more than your independence.
 ----- 
 You greet the day energized! Your confidence is at an all
 ----- 
 You're conscientious where your health is concerned. You're one of the rare few who exercise and eat nutritious meals. Today you might want to expand your repertoire of medical remedies. If you've been struggling to shake a cold or allergy, consider some alternative medicines. They're moving more into the mainstream. Chinese herbs and acupuncture could just be what the New Age doctor ordered!
 ----- 
 This is bound to turn into a silly day if you let it, Taurus. Your best bet is to give in to the strange patterns at work. Communication seems blocked at every turn. You can expect technical difficulties like phone malfunctions or computer crashes. You and your mate will speak in two different languages. No one seems able to get a point across. Don't fight it. Just laugh. All will be normal again tomorrow.
 ----- 
 This isn't a day to make firm commitments, Gemini, especially concerning relationships. Today's atmosphere highlights unification and reconciliation, but don't take this as a sign that you're now bound for life. Proceed carefully before making any long
 ----- 
 You're so upbeat and optimistic by nature that it's difficult for you to accept certain failures. That may be what you're thinking today as you reflect on recent humanitarian efforts. Try not to take such a short
 ----- 
 You're usually very good at concentrating and getting your chores done, even when chaos reigns around you. This likely won't be the case today. Even you will come under the influence of the erratic. It's too hard to get much done with all the commotion. Don't fret about your lack of productivity. This is one day. Relax and have some fun. Tomorrow you can get down to work.
 ----- 
 You have strong psychic vision, Virgo. Some people might say that you're prophetic, but your gift is a combination of creativity and intuition. You can use this to benefit others, and in fact have often done so. You're known for your good advice. Have some restraint today. People are listening closely to what you say. If you advise someone to do something crazy, they might do it!
 ----- 
 The element of water predominates today. You will likely be aware of it by the strong tides of feeling in your household, Libra. Some family members may be unhappy. They may need more independence or look to you for more attention and affection. It's hard to strike the right balance, as you will discover. Do your best to satisfy everyone, making sure that your own needs don't get overlooked.
 ----- 
 There's a carefree, almost childlike atmosphere to today that suits you just fine, Scorpio. You've been working extraordinarily hard lately and need to relax and unwind a bit. This is a day for doing cartwheels across an open field. You aren't the only one who feels this way 
 ----- 
 This is a day for rest and relaxation, Sagittarius. Take advantage of the calm atmosphere to center yourself and focus on what's important in your life. You've been going at full speed, and it's possible that your family feels somewhat neglected. Spend some quality time with loved ones, if possible. They miss you and will welcome your company. Other concerns come and go, but family is forever.
 ----- 
 You're on top of the world today, Capricorn. Enjoy the view! You're unstoppable. Friends and family alike revel in your good mood. You're materially and spiritually generous, and by day's end people could be lined up to partake of the bounty. Try to curb your enthusiasm and use some discretion. It would be better to give more to a worthy few than give less to many.
 ----- 
 This dreamy day is tailor made to your sensibilities. You may find it hard to focus on the daily issues when you're caught up in your fantasies. Go ahead and give in to the day's dreamlike state. Write in your journal or spend some time rummaging around in the attic. You'll be amazed at what you find. Expect to spend hours looking through scrapbooks and reliving your childhood.
 ----- 
 Your artistic side likes to communicate with people who are a shade off normal. You call them eccentric 
 ----- 
 Initiate a deep, meaningful conversation with someone you've lost touch with, Aries. It could be that a long and ugly point of contention is on the brink of resolution. All you need to do is make the first move. There's a great deal of heartfelt, loving energy in the air that will help you foster a sensitive, tender approach. Find a connection with someone that you didn't know was there.
 ----- 
 Your transmission may be stuck in reverse today, Taurus. This doesn't mean you can't be productive. You may need to change your approach. Carefully assess a situation before you proceed. Someone may be trying to cross you. Be smart about your rebuttal. Head
 ----- 
 Things should go well for you today, Gemini. There's an added serenity in the air that will help calm your nerves. There's no need to make things more complicated than necessary. The answers to things are actually quite simple. Everything you want is probably right at your fingertips. You don't need to go far to find what you seek.
 ----- 
 It might seem like someone has dumped a bucket of water on your head today, Cancer. It seems like your fire is out. Keep in mind that this is only temporary and that your internal flame will be rekindled soon. For now, you may want to take this time to slow down and relax. Use this as an opportunity to reflect and tune in to your sensitive, caring nature. Let someone else take the reins.
 ----- 
 Tension may run high today as things come to a great emotional climax. It might seem as if everyone is out to get you, Leo, but more than likely this paranoia is a figment of your imagination. Don't get carried away with crazy scenarios that have no basis in reality. People may be acting irrationally, so don't be surprised if reason and logic are nowhere to be found.
 ----- 
 More than likely you will be caught up in a wildly intense emotional drama if you aren't careful, Virgo. Try to stay calm and collected. Find a quiet, solitary place where you can relax. Your energy is there, but it may be more reserved and subtle on a day like this. Be the stable oasis in the raging turmoil. Make peace with the people around you.
 ----- 
 You will find strength in your inner reserves today, Libra. Don't hesitate to let your deepest thoughts shine through. Keep your antenna up. You will find that there's an electricity in the air that keeps people's emotions at peak level. Follow your instincts and keep in mind that this is probably your best defense against the challenges of the day. Rational thinking is overrated.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit sluggish today, Scorpio. Your warrior spirit would rather stay home on the couch than get up and fight. This is fine. You may simply need a break from your quest for world domination. Remember that a good leader also takes the time to sit back and reflect on recent events in order to make better plans for the future.
 ----- 
 Your sensitivity is strong today, Sagittarius. You will find that your perception of situations is right on target with the truth of the matter. Keep in mind that in order to be successful, you won't need to strong
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit confused today. It might seem as if the wind has suddenly been taken out of your sails. Don't get discouraged by the slow weightiness of the day. Take the opportunity to relax and recharge your batteries. Do a bit of inward reflection as opposed to outer
 ----- 
 Today is an excellent day for you, Aquarius. You will be a welcome addition to any crowd. Your delightful nature is at its most active. You have the unique capability to be aggressive about getting what you want without disturbing the flow of the energy around you. People respect and honor your sensitive, nurturing qualities. This will win the game for you.
 ----- 
 The world probably isn't going to revolve around you today, Pisces, so get used to it. Even though this may not be the news you want to hear, it's probably the news you most need to hear. Use your incredible passion to nurture others. Think less about yourself and more about the people around you, especially your family. Stick close to home and take care of chores.
 ----- 
 Today could be the day you've been waiting for, Aries. Realize that you have the gentle, sincere nature necessary to sweet
 ----- 
 Something is urging you to act, Taurus. You may feel a restlessness in the air that makes you want to get up and go. The problem is the place you need to go may not be obvious at first. Tender emotions may get in the way of decisive action. Realize that your destination is inside your heart. We all go through moody periods. This could be one for you.
 ----- 
 You will find that your emotions are much more under control today, Gemini. You're able to strike a happy balance and avoid extraordinary extremes that scare others away. In fact, quite the opposite is true. People will be attracted to you as you provide a life raft on turbulent waters. Your sensitivity is strong and you're able to immediately fix on the status of any situation.
 ----- 
 Things may seem a little cloudy today, Cancer, but this is no reason to be blue. It could be that you need to adjust before you can smoothly relate to others. Take this opportunity to attend to things that you normally wouldn't think of. See things from the perspective of someone in another walk of life. Realize the fun of just staying home and falling asleep on the couch.
 ----- 
 Try not to see the negative in everything today, Leo. Concentrate on the positive. You will pick up subtle signals from others that can be very helpful as you gather data throughout the day. As you proceed through it, keep in mind that everything need not be a race to the finish line. Enjoy where you are now. There's no reason to rush to the next activity if you're having fun.
 ----- 
 Try to curb your tongue today, Virgo. There's no reason to lash out. You will find that the more sensitive your approach, the farther you will get in your pursuit of your goals. Today might find you feeling moody, and your emotions could be running away with you. Get in touch with your feelings rather than push them away. They're probably trying to tell you something important.
 ----- 
 Your thinking is clear today, Libra, and you will find that generally things are running smoothly. Your perspective on everything is very much in line with where you need to be at this time. In other words, you're doing everything exactly right. Be yourself and let other people adapt to your way of thinking. There's no need to keep hiding the truth of who you really are.
 ----- 
 Listen to what other people say to you today, Scorpio. There are valuable experiences waiting around the corner. The important thing to do now is recognize opportunities when they arise. The road to success isn't always well marked. Take a chance on the road with no signs at all. You have the courage and pioneering spirit to pursue the adventurous route, so go for it.
 ----- 
 Your emotions may be more in tune with the world around you today, Sagittarius. You could even feel a bit psychic. Go with your hunches. You will find that rational thinking may not be the best way to handle situations right now. Be the sensitive one who feels things before acting. Discuss the issues with others and combine your resources for a more powerful alliance.
 ----- 
 You might second
 ----- 
 Today is excellent for you, Aquarius. You will find that things flow naturally in the very way you've visualized. You might even find that things actually go much better than you had envisioned! Go about your endeavors confidently. The whole world isn't out to get you. In fact, people are probably too concerned with themselves to even bother with what you're doing.
 ----- 
 Be careful about the way your words come across to others, Pisces. You might not realize how much other people's feelings are affected until it's too late. Consider backing off for a while and taking a break from your normal performance. Practice your lines at home. You may be in a bit of a funk, but the good news is that you will snap out of it very soon.
 ----- 
 Aries, you shouldn't even try to find a reasonable explanation for what goes on around you today. There isn't one. Be carried by the tides of emotions from the past that run through your body and soul. There's no use trying to control them 
 ----- 
 Today you may ask yourself if you're satisfied. How is your personal life? Do people live up to your standards or are you always left feeling dissatisfied? It may be time to make some important decisions in your life. What do you really want out of life? You might find some of the answers today.
 ----- 
 Nothing is simple where your family is concerned. If you've forgotten that, don't worry. Today will remind you. You may have to deal with some of your lingering problems with certain family members. You will find you have all the energy you need in order to find the solutions to the conflicts that have been eating at you for a while.
 ----- 
 You like to give people advice and help them find direction in their lives 
 ----- 
 Leo, you may put your integrity under the microscope today. We all have deep convictions that we would never let go of. But society pressures us, and it isn't always easy to live in perfect harmony with our ideals. The question to ask yourself today is just how willing are you to change your most heartfelt beliefs in order to live in society? Do you have the courage of your convictions?
 ----- 
 Your freedom is more important to you than anything else in your life. It's often very difficult for you to get involved, whether personally or professionally. Nevertheless, today you may have to think about it. Could it be that your thirst for freedom is just an escape? You may need to ponder this question. Who knows? You could decide to take the leap!
 ----- 
 Certain very narrow
 ----- 
 Today you will be able to explore the power of your emotions. Don't try and fight what you call your "oversensitivity." A force from childhood will permeate you and help you to find out what your real needs are. Shouldn't you think about staying away from people who influence you a little too much? Think about it and go with your emotions.
 ----- 
 Sagittarius, you feel secure in the warmth and depth of your emotions. Today you will have the opportunity to reenergize and regenerate yourself from the inside out. Take advantage of the energies at play to deepen your relationships with the people you love. Get to know them even better. Your powers of seduction will mesmerize them.
 ----- 
 The atmosphere may seem a bit oppressive today, Capricorn. You like to be free to do what you want to do, and it may bother you that the people around you don't make themselves available to you. They seem preoccupied by their own business. This could bring out some old wounds that haven't completely healed.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit tied down today. It won't necessarily be a bad day, but you may wonder about certain aspects of your family life. Don't try and kid yourself. You should think hard about what you want for your family for the next few years and how you intend to go about getting it.
 ----- 
 There are days when you should take everything with a grain of salt. Today you may realize how important it is to gain the appreciation and respect of a certain person. It isn't worth getting worked up about. You will only make things worse. You may just need to do something that puts the fire back into your emotions.
 ----- 
 Whether you acknowledge it or not, there's a child inside you who needs tending, Aries. You're proud of the person you've become 
 ----- 
 Think of today as a well
 ----- 
 Today take stock of all that's occurring on the home front, Gemini. Think back over the last few months and you will see how much of your attention has been on work rather than loved ones. There's probably some fallout as a result. Fortunately, a few days in close touch with family will put everything right. You can't blame them for wanting to be with you. Try to indulge them.
 ----- 
 Think long and hard before making commitments, Cancer. Much is at stake, especially where your love life is concerned. It's likely that a proposal is coming your way. Do you know how you will answer? Events may have you feeling like you're at a crossroads when actually you're more on track than ever. The key lies in trusting your instincts and remaining true to your ideals.
 ----- 
 You will be busy today, Leo. Nevertheless, you still may end the day with your desk piled high with projects 
 ----- 
 You've been working exceptionally hard, Virgo. Today is a good day to recharge your batteries. It seems everyone wants a piece of you. You may have reached the point where you have nothing left to give. It's OK to say so. If possible, take the phone off the hook and reserve the day for yourself. Sleep in, meditate, go for a walk 
 ----- 
 Today could be a turning point for you, Libra. Is it possible that you've finally learned how to say no? You're the one everyone asks for help. You spend so much time on other people's problems that you have little energy left for you. This situation ultimately helps no one. Put yourself first and there will be plenty of you left for others. If you're depleted, everyone loses.
 ----- 
 Today's planetary positions urge you to assert yourself, Scorpio, but take care not to take this encouragement too far. You tend to go a bit overboard when making a point. There are times (and this is one) when subtlety is more powerful. Try being low key and open rather than uptight and defensive. You have a warm personality, so why not let others experience it?
 ----- 
 You have a strong creative component to your personality. You should use it more. Today's planetary positions will influence both your creativity and productivity. You will likely find yourself working as never before, and with better results. Take advantage of this phase while it lasts! This is your moment to prove to others just what you're capable of.
 ----- 
 You're highly sensitive and highly intellectual, Capricorn. This is a wonderful combination and part of what makes you a superstar. Today's planetary positions challenge you to think how you can best combine these two key components of your personality. Have you considered writing? It might provide the sort of balance you seek. Start writing and see if it suits you.
 ----- 
 You may be inclined to stay in bed today with the latest best seller, Aquarius. Who wouldn't want to spend the day this way? Alas, that isn't going to happen. The planets are practically pulling the covers off you and pushing you out of bed. There's work to be done! And more importantly, there are people you need to talk to right now. Put a bookmark in the book. It can wait.
 ----- 
 You have a lot to offer, Pisces. Everyone appreciates what you have to contribute. Yet you've been unable to give yourself credit for all that you've accomplished. It would be worthwhile to take some time to contemplate why this is so. You have a strong need to be loved, but you must first love yourself. Your family and friends will support you, but first you must support yourself.
 ----- 
 It's important to take a hard look at yourself and know where you're going, Aries. A little self
 ----- 
 Taurus, you tend to run away from confrontation, but today you might not be able to avoid it. Your partner or a family member may be putting pressure on you. It's possible you've already worked out a solution to this problem. Tell your partner what he or she wants to hear so you can do what you want later.
 ----- 
 You may feel a little weary today, Gemini. It's a good time to take stock of your life. You may have gotten some news about someone that has caused you some pain. This is a good time to rely on the support of your relationship in order to reenergize yourself. Take the time to let others take care of you.
 ----- 
 You have the gift of being able to get your great ideas across to others. In your family, you may be the one who teaches your children about life and its responsibilities. Today someone might teach you something you didn't know. You should never forget that education means communication, and communication is the exchange of ideas.
 ----- 
 There may be tension in the air as you go about your day, Leo. The leftover fatigue from the past few days is starting to wear on you. You may have managed to get into an argument with someone close to you, but there might be a reason for this. Take advantage of the situation to clear the air with your friend.
 ----- 
 You don't live your life by society's rules, Virgo. Your freedom is what is most important to you. But despite your independence, there are days when you have the sudden, sinking feeling that you could wind up alone in this world. Today you should really begin to think about what the word "commitment" means to you. Is it really so scary?
 ----- 
 Libra, life around you today almost seems like a (bad) dream. It's almost as if people are talking, but nothing intelligible is coming out of their mouths. Perhaps two people close to you are having problems getting along. You feel like stepping in and telling them to calm down and really listen to each other. Days like these are when people need you the most.
 ----- 
 You can't spend all your time running from one activity to the next, Scorpio. You need to take a break from time to time. You have all the energy you need, but you should think about relaxing yourself as a whole. Your body may need its batteries recharged. Pretty soon you will be in the thick of the action and you will need all the energy you can get.
 ----- 
 Today's planetary configuration has you wondering about an aspect of your life that causes you a good deal of hardship, Sagittarius. Maybe your partner is often away, and this is particularly hard on you. You'd like your sweetie to be there through thick and thin. This may be causing some tension in your relationship. Have you talked to your partner about your feelings? If not, you really should.
 ----- 
 Capricorn, you may have been a little difficult to be around lately. You like to treat yourself to a little moodiness from time to time, but the people around you might appreciate a little cooperation. There are days when you don't want to grow up, when it's time to play. Do you get enough time to play? Think about it.
 ----- 
 One thing is for sure, Aquarius, you'd rather be in bed with a good book than out in the stressful world. But you may be feeling like you're missing out on some of the good things in life. How much time do you spend with other people? Why not try to find someone who shares your taste for good books and bed? Think about it!
 ----- 
 Your greatest quality is generosity, Pisces. Your nature isn't to give to others in order to get something back but for the pleasure of giving. This is how you get power and light. Think of all the people in the world who give of themselves without expecting anything in return. You don't have to make much effort to be one of those people 
 ----- 
 Get out of the mud, Aries. Have fun and don't worry too much about the consequences. Put your to
 ----- 
 Your emotions may be volatile right now, Taurus. There's passion behind your words. You have the power to instigate major changes in your life. If you're wise, you will consider multiple ways to make them. Find the part of you that needs a boost, the area that lacks passion. Jump
 ----- 
 If you aren't careful about the energy you dish out today, Gemini, you will find that it all comes back to smack you in the face. Other people are likely to be as stubborn as you, so proceed cautiously. The more you try to control and manipulate others, the more friction will build. Things are likely to explode. Adopt a friendly attitude and try not to take anything too seriously.
 ----- 
 Today is a fantastic day for you, Cancer. You should enjoy a good mood and positive experiences with others. There's most likely a slow
 ----- 
 Other people may be demanding of you, Leo, so do what you can to please them. Don't go overboard in thinking you need to be someone you're not, and certainly don't do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Be generous with your affection, but make sure you receive emotional support in return. There are likely to be some imbalances that need minor adjustments.
 ----- 
 People may be somewhat selfish and self
 ----- 
 It may not be the easiest day to relate to others, Libra, but as usual, if you just go with the flow, you will find that you can have fun. Try not to get caught up in anyone else's drama.

 ----- 
 You need bigger and longer hugs than usual today, Sagittarius. A powerful force is moving through your life and trying to shake things up.

 Finish whatever you didn't wrap up yesterday, Libra. Use the morning to plan, the afternoon to execute, and the evening to relax. Be conscious of time and your physical and mental limitations.

 ----- 
 Give it a rest today, Scorpio. Recharge your batteries. Stick close to home and take a load off your feet. Convince someone to give you a massage, or better yet, go to a professional.

 ----- 
 Get the party started early in the day, Virgo. You may be running from task to task, but this is OK. You have the ability to get a lot done by multitasking and keeping things light.

 ----- 
 Bring your thoughts down to Earth, Libra, especially later tonight. You may be flip
 ----- 
 The earlier portion of the day is apt to flow much more smoothly than the later part, Scorpio. You should get things solidified right off the bat, if possible.

 ----- 
 Let your fun
 -----

 ----- 
 Today could be an unusual one for you emotionally, Libra. Your usual easygoing, adaptable nature could be ruffled by people who try to take over projects that you are perfectly qualified to do.

 ----- 
 Try not to be too arrogant today, Scorpio, even when you're utterly sure you're right about the given situation.

Be on guard for people who may want to ruffle your feathers.
 ----- 
 People may have an extra spark in their actions and an extra bite in their words today. You will find that you may be better off just walking away from any situation that doesn't feel right.

 ----- 
 Express yourself to the fullest today, Capricorn. Feel free to take an unconventional approach when it comes to dealing with your emotions.

An unexpected messenger may crop up to remind you that not everything revolves around your existence.
 ----- 
 There are a couple important issues that you may need to resolve, Aries. Take an active role in the department of love and romance. Feel free to be aggressive about having your needs met.

Your contribution to the group will be appreciated.
 ----- 
 You will find that you relate very well to others today, Virgo, and your communication will prove to be quite valuable.

 ----- 
 You may be tempted to shift into high gear today, Libra, but you're likely to be unsure where to focus your energy.

Dress up and show off your outer as well as inner beauty.
 ----- 
 There's apt to be tension between your heart and your general mood, Scorpio. Your romantic nature will incline you to adopt a selfish, impatient attitude, while the prevailing tone of the day calls for peace and balance. Try to maintain an equal amount of give and take.

Make sure there is harmony among those around you and everyone's needs are taken care of.
 ----- 
 The key today is action, Aquarius. There's a great deal of force pressuring you to get the ball rolling. One of these forces may come from a romantic interest waiting for you to make the next move. You may have many projects on the table and be unsure where to focus your energy. Don't feel like you need to concentrate on any one thing. They key is to maintain balance among all.
 ----- 
 Ignite the fire in your heart, Pisces, and make it burn more brightly than before. Keep in mind that you may need to make compromises in order to be on the same page with your lover in the way you relate emotionally. Make sure everyone gets a chance to be on center stage. Don't hog the podium. Maintain a working balance by letting others have their turn in the spotlight.
 ----- 
 You may find that things are much lighter than they were the past couple days, Aries. This is a good time to let your physical body take a rest and let your mind and fantasy world take over. Take a hot bath and soak for a while. Relax your brain and detach from your duties and obligations. Tread lightly and don't worry so much about what you need to do tomorrow. Concentrate on today.
 ----- 
 A large weight should lift from your shoulders today, Taurus. The air has started to clear, and the winds of communication have started blowing again. Listen closely to the buzz in the air. You can learn a lot by tuning into other people's fantasies. Make sure you keep an open mind and open heart. Discuss your latest achievements. You will have something important to learn.
 ----- 
 People may be abrasive today, Gemini, but you will find after careful assessment that they don't mean any harm. More than likely they aren't fully informed. They're acting on misinformation. There's likely to be a cloudy haze in the air. Everyone will have an opinion on the best way to go about tackling an issue. Rely on your own cunning to cut to the core of the problem.
 ----- 
 Don't criticize the situation until you've come up with a better solution, Cancer. Be creative. You can accomplish much if you approach the situation confidently. Pessimism won't help find a solution. Relax and let your intuition guide you. Feel free to speak with confidence and strength. Perhaps the most fanciful
 ----- 
 Your thoughts may have a dreamy quality today, Leo. You will find that things are less stable than they have been for the past few days. Don't get discouraged by pessimistic people.

 ----- 
 Your emotions are soaring, Virgo, and you should feel free to indulge in your greatest fantasies. Take a break from reality for a while. Let your inner child play. You should enjoy a greater self
 ----- 
 Reward yourself with two desserts today, Libra. Take a bubble bath. Share your fantasies with others and express yourself fully. Don't feel like you have to say yes to every favor that is asked of you. Save some of that nurturing energy for yourself. Feel free to help others in need, but don't do it at the expense of your emotional and physical bank account.
 ----- 
 The weightiness of the past few days seems to be lifting. You will find a slight breeze building that will help fuel your fire, Scorpio. By building a solid foundation, you've created a reliable launching pad from which to take off. Communicate what you've learned with others. Allow your opinion to be heard. A great deal of useful information will be exchanged.
 ----- 
 Now that you have a solid grip on your situation, unexpected things may come along that change the rules again, Sagittarius. It may feel like the chair you just got comfortable in has suddenly been pulled out from under you. Don't get angry. Just realize that this is probably a sign that you need to move on. Keep things new and exciting. Share your thoughts and ideas with others.
 ----- 
 Use gadgets and electronic devices to make life easier today, Capricorn. Why take the time to chop food by hand when you can use the food processor? Realize that there is most likely an easier way to tackle any task. If something seems too hard, ask for advice how to do the job more quickly and efficiently. Information exchange will play a big role in your day.
 ----- 
 Be careful of the information that comes your way today, Aquarius. People may make unwarranted claims and false accusations. The day has a dreamy, innovative quality to it that asks you to venture out on a limb. If all your chores are taken care of, feel free to go exploring

 Maintain an air of detachment, Pisces. Feel free to delve into your fantasy world and let your emotions carry you to another realm. Today is one of those days when you might come up with a new invention that could become the next must
 -----

 ----- 
 Hold on to your hat, Taurus, and be ready for some action. You're coming to a critical point in your emotional cycle when your heart feels heavy. You may feel pinned down by a huge weight, like you're being sucked into quicksand. Grab a branch and pull yourself out. Rise above the current situation with the help of a lofty perspective.
 ----- 
 In a string of intense emotional dramas, the last thing you need is one more, Gemini. Unfortunately, it looks like you're going to get just that. Once again, an incredible romantic scenario is coming to a head, and your emotions are in turmoil. Hold still, wait for the hit, and then proceed. If you have the feeling that you're going to blow up at someone, simply walk away from the situation.
 ----- 
 There's a great deal of grounding energy in your world today, Cancer, which might work to smother your fire. Whatever happens, don't let the embers burn out.

Remember that at the end of the day, you need only be satisfied with the performance of one person 
 ----- 
 Take pressing matters to the hilt today, Leo, especially when it comes to romantic issues and emotional needs. You have all the data you need to make a valid point.

Go with your gut instincts before you trust anything else.

 ----- 
 Calm down and get centered, Scorpio. This is an extremely sensual day that's likely to pique your emotions. You're apt to receive input from each one of your senses, so keep these channels open and available for new information that's trying to break through. Don't be hasty. You're better off taking a reserved, receptive approach today.
 ----- 
 Today is your day to shine in every way, Sagittarius. There's a concentration of energy in your favor, so act boldly and without hesitation. Your emotions are leading the way, and your heart is barely a half a step behind. Follow these forces like the Pied Piper. Let this be the start of a wild ride on a whole new roller coaster of adventures. The time is right for you to lead.
 ----- 
 Your heart and emotions are on the same page, Capricorn, but they may not be on the page you want them to be. It could be that you're reminiscing about an event from the past. What was once a happy set of encounters now leaves you feeling like there are thorns in your side. Focus on the present and let the past become history.
 ----- 
 Let your sensual, nurturing instincts shine through, Aquarius. Rely on your sixth sense. If things start to get rough, remember that you have the ability to keep your cool. Not only is this an extremely important tool but it's also essential to maintaining any sort of stability in the situation. Keep your footing at all times. Your sanity depends on it.
 ----- 
 A solid grounding is apt to be extremely important to you today, Pisces. Hearts may be broken or won, depending on how well you play your cards.

Shoddy efforts will yield shoddy results.
 ----- 
 Plans for a trip could go awry today because of circumstances beyond your control. A postponement might be necessary. This might prove very frustrating for you because you've been anxious to get going. Don't question the workings of the universe, and don't make yourself crazy over it. Whatever setbacks you suffer today might in the long run prove to be blessings in disguise.
 ----- 
 An upsetting dream may disturb your sleep tonight, Taurus. Some disturbing information about finances could prove upsetting today. This might involve your personal funds, those of a friend, the funds of an organization you're involved with, or the world economy in general. Don't go crazy before you find out the true facts. The information is probably erroneous.
 ----- 
 It could be hard to complete tasks today. A disagreement with other household members might give you the idea that everyone is against you. This isn't so, Gemini. Try to be objective and consider other points of view, and don't turn this into a power struggle. Stay calm, take a deep breath, and try to communicate with the others. The results could prove pleasantly surprising!
 ----- 
 Today you might need to run a lot of errands, Cancer. This could prove frustrating. Traffic could be bad, you might not find what you need, and it may be difficult to reach those you need to consult. These are all circumstances beyond your control, so it's best to find something else to do. This is a great day to stay in and research matters that you may want to put to use.
 ----- 
 Your practicality and good sense prove invaluable today, Leo. Those close to you might be restless and upset, and you might have to steer them in the right direction. A close friend or lover may experience a financial upset, and you could be asked to help out. This isn't a good day to make a loan, although it's favorable for helping others find their own solutions.
 ----- 
 A problem with your house 
 ----- 
 An unexpected, upsetting letter or phone call might come today. This isn't major bad news, Libra. It's more likely to be the irritating little setbacks that force you to go more out of your way than you'd expected. Problems might pop up with computers, cell phones, or other forms of technology. Grit your teeth and do what it takes to move on. It won't help to get crazy.
 ----- 
 A sudden, irritating interruption in your routine could come your way today, Scorpio. A friend may need some advice, and you could feel obliged to give it, which would put your own projects on hold for a while. Don't be too irritated with this person, however. You might regret it later. You might also have some troubles with computers, cell phones, or other forms of technology.
 ----- 
 Today your progress might slow a bit. Problems with computers, telephones, cell phones, or other forms of technology might interrupt your day, Sagittarius. This might be frustrating and irritating. Even though you don't usually blow your top, today you might be tempted. Try to keep your cool. This should pass by tomorrow. You don't want to make others more upset than they already are.
 ----- 
 Unforeseen problems with travel plans could come up today, Capricorn. There could be changes or delays in airline schedules, car breakdowns, or bad traffic. It might be a good idea to avoid travel of any sort if you can. It might stress you so much it would take you all day to calm down! This is a great day to stay in and read, especially about scientific or metaphysical subjects.
 ----- 
 Arguments over money might come up, Aquarius. This might not involve your own funds but money belonging to a group with which you're involved. Try to be logical. This isn't a good day to set your sights on new goals or make definite plans. Wait a day or two. If you start today, your project could be fraught with delays, interruptions, or disagreements.
 ----- 
 A disagreement with a business or romantic partner could turn into an argument today. This won't do anything to increase the effectiveness of your relationship, Pisces. If the smallest hint of a difference of opinion comes up, try to settle it before it gets too heated. Try to be objective and see the other person's point of view. Don't let a minor dispute turn into a power struggle.
 ----- 
 You could be feeling especially sociable today. Maybe there's a virtual party of some kind you want to be invited to. You could hear some good news, and there is probably some truth to it, but take everything you hear through the grapevine with a grain of salt. Not everything you hear is based on fact. If you can, go to someone in a position to know and find out from him or her.
 ----- 
 You're feeling especially loving, attractive, and romantic, so romance is likely to be on your mind. Romantic novels and movies could seem especially appealing. If you're currently involved, you will probably receive a lot of attention from your mate. If not, expect to receive admiring glances from those around you, including strangers! You could meet a potential date but take care to get to know this person before getting too excited.
 ----- 
 An increased level of ESP and imagination could have you feeling more creative and artistic. You might want to channel this energy into writing, painting, or adding touches to your living room. You're likely to be especially attuned to the thoughts and feelings of others, particularly family. You could grow closer, especially if you sense what they need even before they do.
 ----- 
 An attractive neighbor with whom you seem to share a bond could become a friend. A group you're affiliated with could be expressing highly idealized goals and purposes. These goals are likely to be admirable, Cancer, but they may not be all that realistic. Bear that in mind before committing to any course of action. You need more facts before you can proceed.
 ----- 
 Dreams of a new career could fill your mind today, perhaps because of too much stress in your current one. You might even think of becoming a movie star! Go for your dream if you feel it's what you want, Leo. Remember that any moneymaking enterprise, no matter how creative, is still a business. Make use of your natural business talent to find out what you need to know.
 ----- 
 Spiritual goals may be at the top of your priority list now, Virgo. You may be looking for online metaphysical seminars or meditation workshops, perhaps taking place in a distant state or foreign country. You're likely to find it difficult to make a decision about any options right now. Whatever you're considering, make sure you know all the facts before making a choice of any kind.
 ----- 
 Lovely dreams could spark your imagination and get your artistic abilities going. You could learn a lot about yourself and whatever has been limiting you. Write down whatever comes your way so you can work with it later, but don't try to make sense of it today. Wait a while and then consider everything in a more practical light. You may be surprised at the difference in you.
 ----- 
 A new friend could arrive today, Scorpio. You're probably going to like this person very much. He or she probably shares many of your interests. You could become close friends. The downside is that you aren't likely to see anyone as they really are, only an idealized picture. When you meet this person, try to see the real person behind the mask and accept them as they are.
 ----- 
 If you've been thinking about a job change or even a new career, a chance interaction could provide the opportunity. However, Sagittarius, remember, "If something seems too good to be true, it probably is." Get the facts as clearly as you can. Consider all the ins and outs before committing yourself or getting too excited about it. If you still want to pursue the opportunity, go for it.
 ----- 
 A journey by air to a distant place might be on your mind, though you might not make it for a long time. Knowledge is important to you, and you can be insatiably curious. This is likely to be one of those days, Capricorn. A friend or lover could bring some new information that sparks your curiosity, perhaps something related to astrology or the occult. You will want to pursue it.
 ----- 
 The desire to beautify your home could hit you full force today, Aquarius. Perhaps you're expecting future visitors or house guests and want to make a good impression. You could prowl through online antique stores looking for knickknacks. You might set your sights on doing something a bit more ambitious than you originally planned. Enjoy yourself but be careful. You don't want to tire yourself out.
 ----- 
 A new neighbor could arrive who you feel especially drawn to, Pisces. You might have high hopes for a friendship with this person. He or she may seem especially congenial and share a lot of your interests, and this could seem almost too perfect. However, you're in just the mood to idealize new relationships, so don't get too excited until you get to know this person better.
 ----- 
 You might wake up feeling a little under the weather, perhaps too tired to go anywhere, and you'll want to stay in. Perhaps this is the best course of action for today. You may be tired and a bit stressed out, Aries, and more vulnerable than usual to any bugs may be going around at this time. Drink lots of juices and get some rest. Tomorrow you will probably feel much better.
 ----- 
 Today you might get the feeling that someone in your family is hiding something. The atmosphere might be strained and somewhat tense. Your natural inclination is to try to spread oil on troubled waters to return the situation to normal, Taurus, but this isn't likely to be the right course of action here. Let things ride. Whoever is hiding something isn't likely to reveal it.
 ----- 
 Gossip you hear today might make you angry. You're likely to sense it isn't true. Take nothing at face value today. Check the facts before making any judgments. Discontent is in the air, Gemini, and when people are disgruntled, they tend to say things they don't mean. Avoid the temptation to be confrontational. It will only make things worse. Try to spend some time alone if you can.
 ----- 
 There is more than meets the eye to a money situation today, Cancer. There could be errors in your financial records, or someone may not be telling the truth about an important item. You're a caring, trusting person, but this isn't the day to blindly accept anyone's statements. Check the facts and see for yourself, then act accordingly in order to see to your own best interests.
 ----- 
 Today, Leo, you probably aren't going to feel very friendly. You're most likely to want to sequester yourself at home and not see or speak to anyone. If your need for solitude is that strong, indulge it. You won't do yourself any good by forcing contact with others. You might feel a little out of sorts physically, so it's especially important to eat right and get lots of vitamin C.
 ----- 
 Self
 ----- 
 Anger and resentment caused by past hurts could come up today, at times tempting you to burst into tears. Don't fight it. Just find someplace where you can be alone and let it out. This is only a symptom of personal and spiritual growth on your part. Releasing the past clears the way for breakthroughs in the future. You could wake up tomorrow morning feeling like a changed person!
 ----- 
 Someone you think of as a friend may prove less than trustworthy today, Scorpio. There are indications of deception all around you. Perhaps someone is keeping something from you or telling outright lies. Don't be too suspicious of anyone but check the facts of a situation before you take someone's word for anything. It's always best to do that anyway.
 ----- 
 Something underhanded is going on, Sagittarius. Unethical people could be trying to manipulate certain situations in order to turn them to their own benefit. Be careful! Steer clear of any "political" conversations, and refrain from commenting on any situation or listening to gossip. On the positive side, your intuition is sharp, so you should be able to sense the trustworthy.
 ----- 
 If you've been thinking about executing legal papers of any kind, Capricorn, this isn't the day to do it. Any contract entered into today is likely to have confusing clauses and obscure language that you may not understand and that potentially could be used against you. This also isn't the day to start or even plan a journey of any kind. However, it's a great day for reading or meditation.
 ----- 
 Money matters look uncertain and a bit deceptive, Aquarius. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of investment program, negotiate salaries or commissions, or change banks. Your dreams may be a bit disturbing, but this likely reflects fears from the past rather than dangers in the future. Write them down, however. You may learn a lot about yourself by studying the symbols.
 ----- 
 New people may come into your life today. If you get bad vibes from one of them, trust your instincts! Signs are that you will meet at least one new acquaintance who isn't trustworthy. This isn't a good day to enter into any kind of partnership, nor is it a good day to get married or even propose marriage. Put all plans for cementing partnerships on hold for a few days!
 ----- 
 If you're involved with the arts, the day ahead will be a bright one for you, Aries. You feel a strong desire to bring people together in pursuit of some artistic endeavor. Listen to your longings. You're likely to be a sharp talent scout, or at the very least, a person who is able to enhance other people's talents.
 ----- 
 Today you can expect to have some disagreements with your partner or friend, Taurus. You may overreact. If you do, it's only because the climate of the last few days has made you feel more vulnerable than usual. It's your tendency when faced with tension to be the first to back down. Try not to do it this time. Sometimes self
 ----- 
 Today you will be confrontational, Gemini. This comes after several weeks of holding yourself back from openly criticizing other people. You have especially strong feelings concerning anything that touches activities outside of the family. An explosion is imminent and likely unavoidable. Go ahead and express yourself. You will all be best friends again tomorrow!
 ----- 
 You must be wondering what in the world is going on? On the one hand, you have humanistic and harmonious thoughts about your family and work environment. On the other hand, you also have a deep desire to destroy everything in order to start fresh! You will have to choose. In any case, given the current climate and the fire inside you, any sort of compromise will prove difficult. Don't go overboard!
 ----- 
 You may be planning for the future, Leo, yet find yourself needing to make choices that will resonate far beyond the next few months. It's possible that you will have to consider sending your children to a new school, for example, or decide to move across the country. These are big decisions, to be sure, but trust that you won't be making them alone. Your loved ones have a say in these matters!
 ----- 
 You can expect to be volatile today, Virgo! No one will dare contradict you or insinuate that you've taken your ideas from others. You have the potential to get really angry. Rather than say things you might later regret, write down your thoughts. And if you do feel the need to make a speech, do it publicly.
 ----- 
 Don't hesitate to speak up for what is right, Libra, even if it means confronting someone with power. So be it. The slightest injustice can't be tolerated. When you voice your opinion, as you feel compelled to do, it makes others respect you. This has been a long time coming, and it does you a tremendous amount of good!
 ----- 
 Scorpio, no one has ever accused you of being overly diplomatic. In fact, since you have no compunction about saying what you think, your mouth regularly gets you into trouble. It's true that your verbal outbursts often relieve tension in tight situations, but there are times when kind words are a more effective way to get a point across. Why not try it?
 ----- 
 There's some likelihood you'll become irritated with someone close to you today, Sagittarius. Just who do they think they are, anyway? How insulting to put on such an act, especially considering how long you've known each other. Whatever you fight about, at the heart of it is your frustration and concern that your friendship may end. Try not to overreact. Express yourself mildly.
 ----- 
 Something's gotten into you today, Capricorn. An iconoclastic imp inside you is determined to tear down every convention, especially in the art world. Why are you so furious with orthodoxy? Did you dream that an imitator stole one of your ideas and made a fortune with it? If you were an art critic, we would expect you to sing the praises of the vanguard.
 ----- 
 If you're involved in an occupation similar to that of your mother or father, Aquarius, today you may question if the choice was yours or preordained. Did you take this career path of your own volition? If not, what is it that you should really be doing with your professional life? You feel rebellious and yearn for more independence. You might want to find more freedom within the confines of your existing career.
 ----- 
 Most people form their opinions on the basis of what they're told by a few people who supposedly know what they're talking about. Certain ideas become fashionable. Today, Pisces, you have no patience for these tendencies. In fact, you're tempted to use vulgar language just to shock the pseudo
 ----- 
 You will float today, Aries. You won't talk, you will be sleepy, and your mood won't be the best. OK, perfect! Get back into your novel, take several siestas, and do as little as possible, because that's what you want to do. Don't worry, busy beaver, this period will pass. And you know what? You aren't alone here. It happens to everyone from time to time. Flow with it.
 ----- 
 You're certainly in a strange mood today, Taurus. True, things have been going smoothly for the past few days but be careful not to be fooled. Pride goes before a fall, as they say. Today you should be wary of your behavior toward your lover. Your partner's attitude may dismay you, but you're the one who has strayed from reality. Stay away from any trigger points that could explode into an argument.
 ----- 
 It will be as though you're in a new and hopeful world today, Gemini. The people you meet will be cordial and caring, and the future will seem like a bright, attractive place to live. In other words, it's like a fabulous dream, and the alarm clock is bound to wake you up soon. True, the glorious feeling won't last long, so take advantage of the day. Reality is sweet at times.
 ----- 
 Because you tend to brood over everything right now, Cancer, a day like this can't be anything but beneficial. It has been difficult for you to find satisfaction within the realm of the known world lately, but today offers you a journey into another perception, one that's intangible and unreal. You may find it gratifying, especially if you try some artistic, esoteric, or religious activity.
 ----- 
 There are days when you feel wonderful without being able to attribute the feeling to any real event. Of course, your rational mind will search for a reason for your happiness. But if you count the number of times when you do things against your will, it becomes obvious that logic and reason don't always apply to this world. Don't even try to understand. Just enjoy!
 ----- 
 The day ahead should be excellent, Virgo. For the past several days you've been searching for meaning in life. There have been changes in your chief occupation, new relationships, bursting ambitions. Today you can let all of that soul
 ----- 
 You will probably be perfectly in tune with the day ahead, Libra. Of course, it's tempting to run away from the reality and hardships of the moment. But at other times, when you're so compassionate and find it easy to listen, like today, life is really rewarding. People find your company soothing and pleasant, and they're likely to thank you for it. Aren't days like this great?
 ----- 
 Don't try to control what happens today, Scorpio, because you won't be able to fathom what's going on. How could it be otherwise when collective currents are interfering with your life? You may do some soul
 ----- 
 This kind of strange day doesn't come around often, Sagittarius. It will seem as though you no longer know what you want. Do you have a yen to take off for the other side of the globe? People won't understand you, and you will think that explaining yourself is pointless. The best thing to do may be to unplug from your usual activities and go for a walk. You have nothing to lose.
 ----- 
 Do other countries represent real openings for you? This is a question that you will soon have to answer. This may be true, but it may also be an illusion that gives you a simplistic explanation for the dissatisfaction you feel now in your professional life. Think about it because some important decisions you're about to make depend on it. You aren't the only one to consider, either.
 ----- 
 You're going to think this is a strange period. It isn't, Aquarius. It's just that today won't be like others. Look around and you will see that people are either depressed or trying to keep up a good façade. It's as if lots of people 
 ----- 
 Today, Pisces, you might get the chance to take a trip around the world to visit fabulous palaces and experience a timeless love, and all 
 ----- 
 This is a good day to look at the big picture and discuss your ideas with others, Aries. As you walk down the street, make sure you pay attention to what's going on around you. If you continue to be preoccupied by one issue, you may never see some of the other important pieces of the greater whole even though they're obvious to everyone else.
 ----- 
 You will be in an excellent mood, Taurus, and find your positive attitude amplified as you communicate with more and more people. The one thing to watch out for today is laziness. There may be a great deal of it going around, especially in your camp. Don't waste the good energy of the day sitting around and doing nothing 
 ----- 
 Speak your mind clearly, Gemini. Other people aren't mind readers like you are. If you keep waiting for someone to figure out what you're thinking, it will be a long time before the truth comes out. Give people a break and let them know what's going on inside your head. Communication is important, and today it begins with you. Feel free to take the first step toward opening the door.
 ----- 
 You can soar to great heights on a moment's notice today, Cancer. There's a fast
 ----- 
 Try to see the positive in people, Leo. Relax and don't get so worked up over your internal drama. You're the one responsible for creating this turmoil. Find comfort in a creative project. Do something that you love to do that makes you truly happy. There's an expansive feeling in the air that's likely to amplify whatever mood you project.
 ----- 
 You should find that the adventurous side of you has the support of your emotions, Virgo. These two parts of your spirit are working in harmony to help you stretch beyond your limits. Push into new realms and ask questions when you don't understand something. This is the only way you will learn, develop, and grow mentally and emotionally. Don't assume learning stops when you leave school.
 ----- 
 Dress in your very best today, Libra. Feel free to kick up your heels and have some fun. This is a great time to communicate with friends, socialize if possible, and have a fabulous time. Put your worries aside and join in some lighthearted fun and merriment. Keep a smile on your face and you will find that you can walk through any door you choose.
 ----- 
 You will find that the more peaceful and understanding you are today, Scorpio, the better off you will be in general. Doors will open and people will welcome you with great fanfare. Be the diplomat instead of the warrior. Focus on the positive aspects of the equation instead of the negative. Luck and prosperity will come your way when you have this attitude wherever you go.
 ----- 
 Make sure you leave things in better condition than you found them, Sagittarius. This is a good time to tidy your personal space and the environment. This is also a great time to do some online shopping for yourself. Just be careful that you don't spend too much money. When beautiful things catch your eye, it might be hard for you to resist them, regardless of how much they cost.
 ----- 
 This is one of those days in which it's easier to be yourself, Capricorn. Don't feel like you need to change your personality to fit a situation. You naturally add an important dynamic to the group. Your detached, unbiased, and knowledgeable view of the situation will be an important asset to today's events. People would do well to listen to you, so be bold when expressing yourself.
 ----- 
 Communication is a key part of the day, Aquarius. You will find that a great deal of information is available to you when you ask for it. You can pull from many different resources, so don't be afraid to tap the different wells available to you. Emotionally, this may not be the best day for you, but you can overcome this as long as you keep a lighthearted, optimistic approach.
 ----- 
 Bring things back into balance, Pisces. You've probably been so focused on yourself that you've completely forgotten about others. It's time to fill in the rest of the equation and take into account what other people feel. Balance is crucial in every part of your life so that you maintain a healthy viewpoint. A clear mind allows you to see the truth of what's really going on.
 ----- 
 Maintain a positive attitude, Aries, and things will naturally flow your way. Tell a few jokes and keep things light and energetic. You will find that you can multitask very well, and you have the ability to make everyone smile. Don't shy away from things 
 ----- 
 You may be reluctant to commit to anything major today, Taurus. Your natural tendency is to look askance at those who promise grand and wonderful things. You're smart to question such talk. Don't be surprised if someone's new idea garners all the acclaim. Don't buy into it without first hearing the facts. It isn't a good day for you to gamble, either.
 ----- 
 This may be one of those days when you feel completely alone even if there are hundreds of people around, Gemini. No one seems to understand your perspective. Your incredible sensitivity and emotionalism are putting you in a category all your own. Try not to ostracize yourself from the group. Reach out instead of pulling away. You have more in common with other people than you think.
 ----- 
 Balance your boisterous, adventurous nature with a bit of discipline today, Cancer. It's important to laugh, but it's also important to stay on task with your duties. The good news is that both of these things can work in tandem. They aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, one will help you achieve the other. Be serious but have a good time and keep things in perspective.
 ----- 
 There may be a thousand things for you to do today, Leo, but you can only get them done if you concentrate on one at a time. Take a lighthearted approach. You will never finish by focusing on the sheer amount of work you have to do. Break it up into smaller pieces and delegate tasks if you can. Try to see the fun side of things. Schedule in breaks and snacks.
 ----- 
 No matter what you're doing today, have fun, Virgo. Whistle a tune. Turn the stereo up to full volume and dance around the kitchen as you make dinner. You can find amusement in just about anything, so keep this in mind as you tackle even the menial tasks. You're responsible for your own attitude, so don't blame anyone else for a sour mood. Turn yourself around and have fun.
 ----- 
 You might need to spend time alone in order to reset your programming, Libra. Other people's influence may be seeping into your psyche. There's no reason to always do or say what other people dictate. Your sensitivity helps you understand things about others, but it can also bring you down if you start to take on their burdens. Try to counterbalance this tendency with more of your own energy.
 ----- 
 You will find that discipline, organization, and a bit of a dramatic flair are exactly the things needed to be successful today, Scorpio. Just because you have to be practical doesn't mean that you have to be stern and grumpy. Remember that taking care of serious matters can actually be fun as long as you maintain a positive attitude about the situation. A smile goes a long way.
 ----- 
 You might find it difficult to deal with people on an emotional level today, Sagittarius. Others could seem too demanding of your attention and want to keep the focus on themselves. At the same time, you will probably need a bit more attention than usual. Try not to be so stubborn! Give people the love they need, and you will find that the love you require will come to you as well.
 ----- 
 You might find your emotions a bit dampened today, Capricorn, but this may not be a bad thing. Try not to blow things out of proportion so much. Don't feel that you need to turn every small story into a major headline. There's no need to exaggerate the truth just to get more attention. Take a more reserved approach to your actions and reactions to all situations.
 ----- 
 Make sure you get your daily dose of laughter and try to come out of your shell a bit more, Aquarius. This is an important time for you to let go of your inhibitions and open up to the world. You may find that there's a sober tone to your emotions, but you can overcome this easily as long as you keep your chin up. There's no reason for you to be gloomy.
 ----- 
 This is an important day for you to give thanks for all that you have, Pisces. Give your loved ones extra hugs and let them know how much they mean to you. If things start to get a bit too serious and somber, you're the one who can pull others out of the rut. There is no need to be sad when you have so much to be happy about.
 ----- 
 Your self
 ----- 
 Jump on board the fast train and see how far it takes you, Taurus. You will be surprised how far you can go with minimal effort. Your grace and polite manners will help you navigate to where you need to be. You're your own ship and there is a large gust of wind filling your sails. Make the most of this energy by shooting for the top and not resting until you get there.
 ----- 
 Flexibility is important today, Gemini. Take the relaxed, laid
 ----- 
 Things coming at you from all sides are forcing you to make a move, Cancer. Try not to feel pressured into something you don't want to do. A nervous restlessness is apt to take over your being and urge you to act. Don't let other people's energies dictate your actions. Secure your position and be strong. Don't be lured into situations you know are bad for you.
 ----- 
 Lock into the practical, grounding force that is not only realistic but also flexible. Attend to details and organize yourself, Leo. Be aware that you may need to alter your course in order to fit with the group energy. Try to work together with those around you to achieve a common goal. Initiating the help of others is easier than you think as long as you stay focused and motivated.
 ----- 
 Today is one of those days in which prosperity is much closer than you think, Virgo. You will find what you seek, but it's up to you to take the first step to going after it. More than likely, you're looking for solid answers to your deep and probing questions. Don't let your inquisitive mind rest until you find the answers that ring true for you.
 ----- 
 Indecision may leave you helpless at a crossroads today, Libra. Others around you could be just as undecided regarding their direction. At the same time, you may feel pressured to take immediate action and you're tired of waiting for others to make the first move. Find answers in simple solutions. There's more than one correct way to go. Your choice is the right one if you believe it.
 ----- 
 Latch on to the expansiveness that comes when you connect with others in the social arena, Scorpio. Communication is a key part of the day. You will find that if you go with the flow, you will land exactly where you need to be. Take the adventurous route and feel free to skip around from one thing to another. There's no need to pin yourself down to only one way of doing something.
 ----- 
 Connect with the stable, grounding energy of the day, Sagittarius, but beware that tension may come in the form of fast talk and misguided information. People might be fickle and frantic. Wait for the dust to settle before you pick which road to take. Impulsive decisions are apt to lead you down paths that might not be the best choice for you now. Try not to think too much!
 ----- 
 The expansive feeling you might be experiencing is apt to be squelched today as you get the feeling that you've lost touch with reality. Make sure you connect with real life, Capricorn, and do a bit of planning to balance your whimsical nature. Things that you haven't accounted for might crop up and hit you, serving as a reminder that you need to deal with the here and now.
 ----- 
 Walk to the beat of your own drum, Aquarius. If you try to latch on to the glib, fast
 ----- 
 Talk to the person sitting next to you on the bus, Pisces, or the one behind you in line at the store. He or she may have a piece of wisdom to share that will change your life forever. Know that you, too, could be that person who changes someone else's life with a single thought or piece of wisdom. Communication is the key to expanding your world in many ways.
 ----- 
 There may be too much fiery energy in the day to make you feel comfortable with the situation, Aries. Instead of trying to resist this powerful force, it would be better if you embraced it. Use this day to draw out some of your inner flame and let it radiate toward the people you care about the most. This is a day to take action on your feelings instead of swallow them without a word.
 ----- 
 You may find that others are hostile toward you today, Taurus. Try not to take it personally. Realize that there are other people and situations with which you can connect that will help bolster your ego instead of dragging it down. Make deeper connections with your loved one tonight by indulging in some adventure fantasies. Shared experiences will be extremely rewarding at this time.
 ----- 
 Put your incredible sensitivity to work for you today in a way that inspires action, Gemini. There's so much within you that needs expression at this time. Don't hold back any longer. When it comes to issues regarding love and romance, feel free to make a move. You may be attracted to those who tickle your brain cells. Philosophical discussions will be quite rewarding.
 ----- 
 Things should be going well for you today, so don't miss the opportunities that await you, Cancer. There's a sparkle in your eye that's unmistakable, and you will find that issues regarding love and romance are especially potent. Love is on your side. You should take this opportunity to delve deeply into a love affair. Take a trip with the people you enjoy most.
 ----- 
 Don't let other people's insensitive actions dictate your mood today, Leo. Your state of mind is your responsibility, and you should work to come to a point at which you have full control over what you feel at all times. If something isn't working out, let it go. This isn't a good time to try to stick a square peg in a round hole.
 ----- 
 You should find that you have an extra amount of creative energy now, Virgo, and you should do what you can to make this force work for you. There's a time and place for everything, and now is the time to work together with your higher self to channel some of the artist within. Don't let your self
 ----- 
 You may have been a bit indecisive lately when it comes to love and romance, Libra. Perhaps your mind is drawn to one person while your heart is drawn to another. Perhaps you're trying to trick your mind into seeing a certain quality in someone while you ignore parts that you don't really like. Make sure you accept people for all of who they are and not just the individual parts.
 ----- 
 You're apt to be in a romantic mood today, Scorpio. Your whole being may revolve around love and romance. You will find that your romanticism is heightened. This is a terrific day to snuggle up to a loved one and share intimate moments and passionate kisses. Pamper yourself with a hot bath and try to make someone else happy.
 ----- 
 Feel free to strike out for new territory today, Sagittarius, especially when it comes to love and romance. It could be that you're so scared of losing what you have that you refuse to take risks to obtain something better that you want. Realize that you will never get any further than the rut you're in until you take a deep breath, aim high, and shoot for your dreams.
 ----- 
 Things regarding love and romance may be climactic for you now, Capricorn, and you may bump heads with someone in a way that makes it difficult for either one of you to be content. More than likely there's an issue of freedom versus control that's making it difficult to find a resolution. Perhaps you need to give a certain issue a break and come back to it later.
 ----- 
 You may find that you're taking a much more daring approach when it comes to love and romance now, Aquarius. If you aren't, then maybe you should. You will never know the possibilities until you at least give it a try. You may find that there's something spurring you on today. Use that impulse to initiate a new path toward the object of your desire.
 ----- 
 Things should go well for you today, Pisces, especially in the love and romance department. Don't shy away from the obvious attraction that you have toward one special person. Today is the day to amplify that feeling instead of hiding from it. Show off your love with the brightest, boldest colors and actions possible. There is magic in the attention that you give and receive.
 ----- 
 Unguarded words on the part of a younger person might lead to upset. If the words are directed at you, don't take them seriously. The person doesn't know any better. If the words are directed at someone else, don't be tempted to lash out at the person who said them. Correct him or her gently. Either way, keep it to yourself and then forget it. It isn't worth the stress.
 ----- 
 Profligate spending over the past week or two may have you feeling less confident about your money situation today, Taurus. Perhaps you've lent some money to a friend and you doubt their ability to repay. Or maybe you fell for a sales pitch that you now regret. Correct the situation if you can. If you can't, simply learn from the experience and put it behind you.
 ----- 
 Your ambition and will to succeed may be at war with your feelings today, Gemini. Perhaps you've been working so hard that you aren't paying enough attention to friends and family 
 ----- 
 Today, Cancer, you might uncharacteristically decide to sequester yourself away from the world. Perhaps you're tired or feeling a bit under the weather and only wish to kick back and read a good book. That's fine. Everyone needs a little solitude from time to time. The only concern here is that if you stay too secluded, you might miss an important communication. Resist the temptation to turn off the phone!
 ----- 
 A quarrel over money could interfere with a friendship today, Leo. Perhaps someone hasn't repaid a loan and the lender now needs it. Perhaps a member of your household is unable to pay their share of the bills. Don't let yourself get drawn into quarrels or recriminations. Work something out with your friend if possible. Money isn't worth throwing away a friendship and leaving a gap in your life.
 ----- 
 Spiritual and metaphysical studies may take up a lot of your time today, Virgo. You might want to dig into the world's major religions or try to make it through works about spiritualism or the occult. If you want to, this is the day to do it because your concentration is very strong, although it will be necessary to take a lot of breaks!
 ----- 
 You might long for a vacation today, Libra, and you could toy with the idea of a future journey by air. Your mind may turn to spiritual places such as India, Egypt, Israel, or Ireland as you wonder how it would feel to stand in the sacred places in those countries. Don't just toy with the idea. You're probably overdue for a trip that would suit your mystical nature.
 ----- 
 Someone you've known for a long time may move away or otherwise vanish from your life. He or she may move to a distant state. You'll probably stay in touch by phone or email, but it will never be the same, at least not for a long time. You will feel better if you meet some new people. They will come your way today, possibly through humanitarian group activities.
 ----- 
 There might be some tension between you and your romantic partner that might have you feeling a bit depressed. The key to patching this up is honest communication. Remember that honest doesn't necessarily mean brutal. Confrontations now can only widen the rift. Tell your partner how you feel, Sagittarius, but don't cast blame for anything. Share a little. By day's end, all should be well.
 ----- 
 Today your biorhythms may be a little low, Capricorn, so you aren't likely to be feeling very sociable. You're more likely to want to bury your nose in your projects instead of being your usual outgoing self. This is OK but take care that you aren't so reclusive that you miss receiving some sincere compliments. That can make a big difference in the way you feel!
 ----- 
 An electrifying attraction to someone you may have just met could cause your mind to dwell on sex and romance today, Aquarius. If you can, set up a romantic evening with a love partner. If this isn't possible, watch a movie that moves you to tears. Movies may be of particular interest to you today, since you might be reading about how they're made.
 ----- 
 Family members could be upset over different frustrating events in their lives, and these moods could spill over to you. Today it would be best to leave them alone to work things out in their own way. They aren't likely to respond to sympathy. Take this opportunity to tend to some of your concerns that you may have postponed. This way, the silence in the house can work for you.
 ----- 
 There is some likelihood that the mood at home is fraught with tension, Aries. Did you dare to express some contrary intellectual opinion? In any case, it looks like your self
 ----- 
 It would seem that your sensitivity is in slight conflict with your actions, Taurus. You continue to go through the motions and do what you planned to do, but it seems like your heart isn't in it anymore. Don't ask yourself why. It's just that you've worked hard and have been thinking hard lately. You have reached your limit and it's time for you to rest.
 ----- 
 You may have been spending or saving too much money, Gemini. It's clear that a rebalancing is in order if you're to find pleasure rather than eternal frustration. It's a curious phenomenon. It's as though you have lost contact with your body. Yet it's in your body where you will ultimately find your balance. You certainly won't find it in your head!
 ----- 
 You've been stamping the ground impatiently. You're waiting for the moment to jump into new adventures with renewed vigor after your meditation of the last few months. Cancer, know that the moment has almost arrived! You now have the strategy, objective, and means at your disposal to succeed. Just a bit more work remains. Gather your strength and get ready for action!
 ----- 
 If you find yourself tired and irritable now, Leo, you should know that this is normal. You may have had a few months that were a little too studious. Would you like to continue with the same rhythm? Be careful that your ambitions don't lead you to physical exhaustion. If you get sick, you will be even more frustrated. So be wise and take care of your own basic needs.
 ----- 
 This is going to be a good moment to look elsewhere, Virgo. You should do just as the artist does when he has worked on a painting for too long, which is take a step back. You need to see some people, travel, go to the theater, and clear your head. This is never easy for you, but don't hesitate. You will realize afterward that it was the best thing for you to do.
 ----- 
 This is the right moment to extricate yourself from relationships that have seen their day, Libra. This won't be easy, but you must. In your professional and private lives, you're too hesitant to get out of distasteful situations or obligations. You're afraid of hurting people or making them mad. But in the end, you're hurting yourself. Give more weight to your own needs and follow your own path.
 ----- 
 You took off like a bullet a few days ago, Scorpio, making great progress in a short amount of time. But now you're grappling with doubts that are undermining all your energy. Reflecting on the events of the past few days, it's obvious that you were somewhat reckless in your headlong pursuit of your goals. Don't give up! Just rethink your strategy.
 ----- 
 There is some likelihood that thoughts of your love life will haunt you today, Sagittarius. Perhaps you're intrigued by the idea of exploring certain realms of your relationship that remain secret, but you're unsure how to communicate this to your mate. Perhaps you're still testing the waters, waiting until you're sure of how you feel. In any case, you may decide to proceed!
 ----- 
 Today more than ever you will yearn to escape from the daily routine. You're thirsty for new sights and sounds, new faces and places. However, you're well aware that you must juggle your desires with your professional or domestic obligations. It isn't always easy, but you should trust your imagination to suggest a way to amicably settle this conflict.
 ----- 
 Finally, you're on the mend, Aquarius. The minor ailments that have been dragging you down lately are beginning to disappear, and you're about to regain all of your physical energy. However, if you overindulge, your energy levels are likely to plummet again. If nothing else, you will have learned a valuable lesson about the importance of moderation, especially now. Don't overdo it!
 ----- 
 Do you feel a little under the weather, Pisces? It's possible, considering all the emotional turmoil you've been through lately. It takes time to recover from those storms. As you know, the work itself isn't what gets you down but rather your worries about the future that drain your energy. Give yourself a break today. Take some time for rest and recuperation.
 ----- 
 Put your foot down today, Aries. Don't let others push you around. It could be that you're used to letting people have their way in order to keep the peace. The problem with this is that your dreams and goals may get lost in the shuffle. Don't lose sight of your true destination. There's much more to life than you might see on the surface. Dig deeper.
 ----- 
 For goodness' sake, decide today, Taurus. The more you flounder about which way to go, the likelier it is that you will miss the boat altogether. You have all the facts you need, so don't delay any longer. Once you make up your mind, be strong and throw all your weight behind it. Your mind can be like a computer filing away information as long as you stay alert.
 ----- 
 Mentally, you're apt to do very well today, Gemini. You will find that you can tackle just about any cerebral challenge that comes along. The most difficult aspect of the day will be dealing with your emotions. More than likely, you will feel a great desire for attention. You just want to be loved. Get up on stage and say what's in your heart. This isn't a good time to harbor your feelings.
 ----- 
 Your heart is in the right place today, Cancer, so feel free to share your good mood with others. Keep things simple and straightforward. Try not to complicate issues with unnecessary garble. Streamline your thoughts and actions. You will find that you can be much more efficient when you cut out the aspects that aren't pertinent or absolutely necessary. Follow your heart.
 ----- 
 You may find it hard to get rolling today, Leo. It's likely that you're caught in a gridlock between your mind and heart. Be careful about letting this tension build. The most important thing for you today is to relax. Tackle things one step at a time and finish one project before starting another. You could get overwhelmed if you have too many things on your plate at once.
 ----- 
 You're apt to be spurred into action by strong forces that don't want you to take a break, Virgo. Keep in mind that the more you resist, the more you will be pushed and pulled by outside sources. If you find yourself in a bind, take a deep breath and calm down. Act from a point of neutrality instead of a point of anger or defensiveness.
 ----- 
 Feel free to let it all out today, Libra. It's finally your turn to stand up and say what you feel. Don't let others push you into places you don't want to be. The key is to probe deeply with your penetrating mind and share your incredible insights with others. Don't be surprised if your actions cause some tension. Don't let this stop you from doing what you feel is right.
 ----- 
 Emotionally speaking, you're probably doing quite well today, Scorpio. You have extra self
 ----- 
 You might be in a bit of a jam today, Sagittarius, when one person or situation doesn't work well with what you're thinking, and another doesn't fit well with what you're feeling. There's a clash taking place that may be difficult to reconcile, especially if you remain stubbornly in your position. The more flexible you are, the better off you will be.
 ----- 
 Today is a good day for you to follow through, Capricorn. Normally you're much better at tagging along or simply going with the flow of the situation. This way of doing things has proven quite effective for you in the past. Indeed, it has gotten you far. What you have now is a different situation. The things you've started will do you no good until you complete them.
 ----- 
 Have sympathy for those who need to vent today, Aquarius. Don't be surprised if people line up outside your door for a chance to bend your ear for an hour or two. Your mind is sharp. You will be able to see to the core of any issue brought before you. More than likely, you will understand things intuitively. People will do well to take your advice on any issue they have.
 ----- 
 You will probably want everyone to know how you feel today, Pisces. You won't be shy about expressing your emotions. Feel free to take the lead on matters, for you have the self
 ----- 
 Get things taken care of in the morning so you can be carefree and laid back in the evening. It's important for you to square things away in your head so you can communicate important information to others later. Feel free to take an unconventional approach. It's important to march to the beat of your own drum and not anyone else's.
 ----- 
 Your usual lazy attitude is apt to receive a burst of energy tonight, Taurus. It's in your nature not to want to lift a finger, but for some reason you may be compelled to get up and get moving. You will find that when you connect with others, you're more motivated to make things happen for yourself. When you get the attention you feel you deserve, your devotion is strong.
 ----- 
 You may find your emotions difficult to deal with, Gemini, especially later in the day. Consider taking an intellectual instead of emotional approach. Your feelings could send you into a drastic mood swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. The thing you really need right now 
 ----- 
 Communication with others could be extremely rewarding, Cancer, especially later in the day. Project more of your energy outward and join others in projects that you might otherwise try to tackle on your own. Things should flow smoothly as long as you take a lighthearted, optimistic approach. Move forward with projects instead of just contemplating their completion.
 ----- 
 Make sure you solidify your affairs early in the day, Leo, because the sparks are going to fly after sunset. People might try to throw you off balance with fast talk and fancy ideas. You need to make sure you're on solid ground before you take the next step upward. Balance your emotions so you don't take your frustration out on others. Focus on your goals.
 ----- 
 Things are looking up for you, Virgo, especially later in the day. Pieces should be coming together and things flowing into place naturally. You will find that your outward
 ----- 
 The energy is apt to pick up in your life today, Libra. You may be asked to report to duty. Don't make promises you can't keep. Your words will be taken seriously, and you shouldn't mislead people into thinking that something is going to happen when you know it isn't. You know how that situation will turn out. Trust yourself, regardless of the circumstances.
 ----- 
 There's extra aggression in your world today, Scorpio. Realize that this is probably due more to your reaction to a situation than to the situation itself. It could be that you're in conflict with someone just because he or she wants harmony while you have a propensity to fight. This paradox is likely to be detrimental to your psyche unless you try to change it.
 ----- 
 Your mood may take a bizarre twist today, Sagittarius, as you calm your desire to fight for something. You're probably more interested in enjoying the beauty of something rather than trying to keep it for yourself. Allowing someone or something else to be free is the best gift you can give. Keep the lines of communication open and you will find that everything falls into place as it should.
 ----- 
 Things are going to get better and better for you as the day progresses, Capricorn. Try to get your grounded, practical, and logical self collected during the day so you have the evening to socialize and commune with close friends, if possible. Balance is going to be a key issue for you today, so make sure you keep things in check before any one part of your life gets out of hand.
 ----- 
 There may be a bit of aggravation in a part of your life that's urging you to get up and do something, Aquarius. It could be that you're getting overly emotional about a certain issue, and that you need to consider more of the cold, hard facts of what's really going on. You could be missing something obvious simply because you're so caught up in your emotional drama.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit stodgy today, Pisces, but things are going to pick up tonight. There will be a great deal of air to fuel your fire, and you're ready to burn! You could be like a desert of dry sagebrush just ready to be set alight. The whole mountainside is about to go up in a beautiful blaze of glory. You're ready to shine like the brilliant star that you are.
 ----- 
 When the day is done, you will look back on it as an unusual one, Aries. Wild ideas sprouted in your head like mushrooms. You may have imagined leaving immediately for a trip around the world, or drawn up plans for a housekeeping invention, or visualized an entirely new opening in the online world. Don't dismiss these ideas as unrealistic. They are not.
 ----- 
 There's likely to be some tumult in your emotional life right now, Taurus. You may feel a pressing need to have a heart
 ----- 
 Friends and family, while dear, can be irritating today, Gemini. Everyone around you seems upset and unable to communicate clearly. Fortunately, your temper has a long fuse. To avoid a sudden explosion, it would be a good idea to avoid home and the tensions there. If you take a break from your normal routine, you're likely to meet people who will put you in a calmer frame of mind.
 ----- 
 All dissatisfaction will be abolished today as you systematically confront and resolve all the little problems that have been bothering you. Your tolerance threshold is low to nonexistent. Give a wide berth to friends who have been irritating lately. Your wardrobe improves dramatically as you discard all those clothes that don't fit or no longer suit you.
 ----- 
 You're rarely surprised or bothered by the occasional setback. Today, however, you should put a firm hand on any project you undertake. This isn't the time for a relaxed attitude, especially where money is concerned. If you take a systematic approach, you will have the double benefit of conserving both energy and assets.
 ----- 
 Expect to be torn between two seemingly paradoxical urges today, Virgo. Part of you wants to spend the day wrapped in a cocoon, playing with your toys. But another side of you is just as committed to spearheading a major creative or social endeavor with friends who share your revolutionary ideas. You feel exhausted from trying to build the perfect world.
 ----- 
 You're often called the "cleanup crew." Whether it's the home or the unconscious, you enjoy preparing nests for all sorts of births, real and figurative. Don't be surprised if you find yourself tidying up your home, throwing away useless things, clearing the desk, or catching up on mail. There are powerful forces compelling you to prepare for someone or something new and different.
 ----- 
 Act without hesitation today, Scorpio, especially if you're following unfamiliar directions or exploring new territory. This may not seem like the best advice, but this is a day for saying an unflinching yes to all manner of proposals that come your way, even if some are unclear. Scorpio excels at this type of test. Expect to be at the head of the class by the end of the day!
 ----- 
 You're obviously struggling with something big, Sagittarius. Recent comments about your irritability are well founded. But don't worry. They'll forgive you eventually. In the meantime, do what you can to control your temper. It stems from your current fears, which seem to be multiplying exponentially. Blame the situation on the planets and accept it as a lesson on the path to self
 ----- 
 Expect to be in a provocative mood today, Capricorn. For the past few days, you may have been searching for an outlet for the overflowing energy you're so lucky to have. You will have an opportunity today, as innovative projects are likely to come your way. If you face your demons, you will find a unique opportunity to rid yourself of the fears you've been carrying around for so long.
 ----- 
 Your passions have been stirring like a caged animal for the past several days, Aquarius. Now is the time to let them out. Some of what you express may elicit surprise or disapproval, but that's no reason to stay silent. If you don't express yourself, illness may result. Your goal should be to be true to your inner self. Ultimately, that's the only way to be happy and healthy.
 ----- 
 What an odd day, Pisces! You feel like you've been given a one
 ----- 
 You aren't the only one who can solve your problems, Aries. Trust that there are others who are capable of understanding. Those who want to help you are motivated only by love, with no ulterior motives. It's in your nature to be skeptical, but these people do exist. And guess what? You could communicate with one of them today!
 ----- 
 Have you noticed how delays seem to occur more often, Taurus? Today will be no exception. Something you've been waiting for has been delayed yet again. It may be that the order form got lost or that there was some unforeseeable delay in sending it to you. Even with your mild
 ----- 
 Get outside and get moving, Gemini! If you can manage to take the day off, this would be a good time to release some energy. You used to enjoy competition when you were little. Remember how exhilarating it was to be the first to the top of the hill? You will find your life greatly enriched if you could find a way to rekindle similar feelings.
 ----- 
 Devote the day to your children or partner, Cancer. You may protest that it's too hard to find the time to give them the attention they deserve. You don't have time for yourself, much less anyone else. In any case, you will probably feel torn between what is expected of you and what you feel you can realistically give. If you want to dispel the inner tension, take care in the choices you make in the next few weeks.
 ----- 
 A friend or family member is slowly poisoning your relationship, Leo. A misunderstanding between the two of you will ultimately prove beneficial in the long run. Why? It makes you realize how uncomfortable you are with vague, ill
 ----- 
 You've been a social butterfly lately, Virgo! The sociable phase you're currently in demands a great deal of energy. You're attracted to some of your new acquaintances but irritated by others. One in particular causes you real anxiety today. You have two choices. Either abandon your new group of friends entirely or expel the person who's causing you trouble.
 ----- 
 Your thin skin feels even thinner than usual today, Libra. If you happen to witness a violent outburst in the street, at work, or on television, you suddenly become aware of your vulnerability. Don't let it frighten you into hiding. As one of the few remaining guardians of the world's dwindling reserves of kindness, you have a responsibility.
 ----- 
 People sometimes say that you're a little aggressive in your approach, Scorpio. But today you feel a little tired of leading the charge on the battlefield. You can learn a lot from your friends who can teach you to think of things in relative terms without allowing yourself to become emotionally involved in every situation. Try to relax for a change!
 ----- 
 You may be a bit oversensitive today, Sagittarius. It's possible that you will be irritable and conflicted as you begin to suspect that long
 ----- 
 There's no point in trying to make sense of today, Capricorn. Much of what happens occurs on an unconscious level and defies any rational explanation. You may have had a dream last night worthy of professional interpretation. If you can bear turning off your intellect, this could be a very profitable day for you.
 ----- 
 This is a confusing period for all of us, Aquarius. But no doubt you've noticed this. In such circumstances, some people become more rigid than ever because they resist dramatic change. They try to hold on to tradition. Your Aquarius sensitivity makes you very receptive to the past, but current conditions should inspire you to let go of some of your convictions.
 ----- 
 What do you have to lose, Pisces? The planets are shaking you in the hopes of ridding you of your old objectives to make way for new growth. You feel doubt where once there was only certainty. When you consider the worst that can happen, it may help you to realize that what you're clinging to really isn't all that important. It's time to let go and begin anew.
 ----- 
 Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will never hurt you, Aries. The problem with the energy today is that there may be some sticks and stones tossed in your direction. Be on the lookout for such objects. There are powerful forces operating that are charged with emotional aggression. War may break out if you aren't careful. Try to maintain the peace.
 ----- 
 Emotionally, things might get rather tense for you as others tend to demonstrate a selfish attitude, Taurus. Selfishness doesn't always have to be considered a negative. Sometimes it's healthy and necessary to take a more self
 ----- 
 You might be stirred by the energy present in the air today, Gemini. Put on your armor and get ready to do battle. Others may cower when they look out their window and see what's going on outside, but you want to jump into the fray. Strong, aggressive emotions are the weapons of the day, and everybody knows that you have quite an arsenal in this department.
 ----- 
 Move in for the touchdown today, Cancer, and don't stop until you succeed. Don't let other people's insecurities become yours. Have confidence in yourself and the way you behave around others. Just because someone else feels sad doesn't mean you have to, just to make them feel better. The best thing you can do in this situation is turn it around by exhibiting sheer happiness.
 ----- 
 Now is the perfect time to say something to someone that you've been meaning to say for quite some time, Leo. Get it out in the open. Keeping it inside will only eat away at you. Stop worrying about the consequences and make the move. Today is the time to be bold and aggressive. Other people might respond in a similar fashion, so if you dish it out, be prepared to take it.
 ----- 
 Your opinions might be the topic of conversation all day, Virgo. You have a very strong will and you aren't afraid to express it. Today you will get that chance. Feel free to enlighten others with your tremendous wealth of knowledge. Take control of the conversation and accept the mental challenge of trying to win other people over to your side. Whether you're successful or not, you will have fun trying.
 ----- 
 Your sensitive heart may be sparked by anger today, Libra. Don't be afraid of hurting other people's feelings. You'd be doing yourself and others a disservice by not revealing the true scope of your emotions. The other parties involved may not have all the facts necessary to make the most educated decision. Aid in this process by revealing your perspective.
 ----- 
 You might feel a great deal of physical power on a day like today, Scorpio. If someone asks you to come help move a couch, you're likely to be able to pick up the whole thing by yourself. Don't sell yourself short. You have more internal strength than you reveal to others. There's no need to hide it any longer. Feel free to make use of this great power you possess.
 ----- 
 The ship is headed out, so you'd better hop on board, Sagittarius. People aren't apt to be too sympathetic to your emotional sob story today, so keep it under wraps. Whining will get you kicked off the boat altogether. Today's energy is teaching you to toughen up. Don't take it personally. Realize that there are important lessons we all need to learn. One of them is to know when to be silent.
 ----- 
 You'll want to jump into action today, Capricorn. Feel free to order others around for a change and delegate. An aggressive approach is exactly what's called for, and you have the ability to deliver the goods. Trying to do everything yourself may seem like a great idea at first, but you're better off enlisting help so others can feel involved and you can concentrate on doing a better job on fewer tasks.
 ----- 
 Guard your heart today, Aquarius, for it's a prime target of the abrasive words flying around. Your sensitive nature feels alone and vulnerable in this harsh atmosphere, so you might be better off just staying in bed. If you decide to go out, make sure to bring your arsenal. Use your sensitivity to your advantage. Scope out your weaknesses so you're able to use your energy most efficiently.
 ----- 
 We need to have more people like you in places of power, Pisces. And don't feel like it's out of the question. Today's astrological weather is helping you find the confidence and physical strength you need to boost your leadership abilities. This is the time to take control of the situation. You can do it!
 ----- 
 Your imagination might conjure stories or pictures that you want to memorialize through writing or painting, but a lack of self
 ----- 
 Attendance at some kind of group event might seem especially appealing today. However, Taurus, worries about your family might distract you so that you don't benefit from it the way you should. You also might find some of the conversation boring. Despite your lack of enthusiasm, it might be a good idea to get out anyway. Staying home alone could make for a gloomy evening.
 ----- 
 Let's face it, Gemini. Today you're likely to find your chores and errands exceedingly boring. You could find yourself watching the clock, feeling like an hour has gone by and then realizing it's only been ten minutes. If you can put off your tasks until tomorrow, by all means do so. Nothing is so urgent that it requires your undivided attention all day. Treat yourself to a fun afternoon.
 ----- 
 You might be distracted by daydreams of a trip you're planning to take, Cancer. A friend could phone and want to discuss it, which doesn't help. Visions of faraway places and exciting pastimes may dance in your head, and routine tasks seem incredibly tedious and unworthy of attention. It's best to get them done if you can. Then you can fantasize about your vacation without guilt!
 ----- 
 You might not have heard from a close friend in a long time and worry a little, Leo. Perhaps this person wasn't well the last time you talked. If you can, it might be a good idea to call. Strange and unsettling dreams could plague your sleep tonight, but don't get too agitated. They aren't prophetic in any way. The symbols probably represent nothing more than psychic detritus released through sleep.
 ----- 
 An older visitor might come to your door today, Virgo. You aren't likely to be too thrilled about this, but you will be able to play the good host anyway. Romance and sociability may be a bit limited by obligations to family, particularly parents, but don't let it get you down. You may be stuck at home tonight, but you will be able to let loose later.
 ----- 
 Mundane tasks, including errands and answering correspondence, might bore you all day, Libra. You're likely to be restless and strongly tempted to chuck it all and go somewhere to enjoy yourself. Take a good look at what you're doing and try to judge objectively how important it is to get it done now. If it isn't that important, then put it aside. You probably need to relax!
 ----- 
 Financial issues may interfere with your self
 ----- 
 A charismatic person might contact you today and want your help with something. Emotional issues regarding family might have you feeling gloomy. Your creative side may have to lie fallow while you attend to mundane issues. Basically, you feel pretty optimistic about your life and future. You're never afraid of hard work, and you're persevering. Go for what you want and make everyone happy, including yourself!
 ----- 
 Worries about relatives or friends could plague you throughout the day, Capricorn. Perhaps you aren't sure what's wrong and so you feel helpless. Whatever vague worries you may have, don't try to figure out the truth without knowing the facts. You could make mountains out of molehills. This isn't a good day to run errands. Delays and obstacles could cause a lot of frustration and wasted time.
 ----- 
 Small group functions and social events might not prove as satisfying as usual today, Aquarius. You may not be in the mood. You might feel pressured to mingle when you'd rather sit on the couch. Whatever conversations you get into will seem trivial and boring. This is a good day to sit back and listen. You might learn from the people around you without having to say a word.
 ----- 
 Pride might get in your way today, Pisces. Perhaps you will be asked to do a task that you consider beneath you. Perhaps the people around you are feeling persnickety. Rise above the insults and make a special effort to do the best you can, defusing the situation before it gets out of hand. Tonight, enjoy an evening of watching movies or listening to music.
 ----- 
 You're going to be a valuable asset to others today because of your rational mind and ability to think things through clearly. The stubborn forces around you aren't going to bend, but you have the unique ability to do so. Do your best to avoid fights, even though it will be tempting for you and others to want to let off some steam.
 ----- 
 In your attempts to always be the nice, helpful one, Taurus, you might find that you're compromising some of your values. Know that balance and harmony are wonderful things, but they aren't always worth the price of self
 ----- 
 Actions could be quick and intense today, Gemini. Things may hit you like lightning, so be prepared for just about anything. Mentally stabilize yourself before interacting with others. Dress to demonstrate your power. You're a force to be reckoned with, not one to be stepped on. Violent emotions are apt to emerge. Don't fight the urge to release any anger you feel. Direct it appropriately.
 ----- 
 Your playful attitude is apt to be opposed by someone who refuses to see things your way, Cancer. Walk away from those who aren't committed to helping the situation. It could be that there are people who purposefully try to sabotage your plans. You're too smart to fall into this trap. Prove to others that even though you may be happy, it doesn't mean you're gullible.
 ----- 
 Today may be one of those days in which you're trying to paint a large area, but you only have a small brush. Your strokes are careful and calculated. You're doing a neat and precise job, but you're also doing things the hard way. Go easy on yourself and get a large brush. Make your strokes gigantic so you can cover more area with less effort.
 ----- 
 You may be barking up the wrong tree today, Virgo. Before you waste all your energy on your podium proclaiming your thoughts to the world, it would behoove you to stop, look around, and notice your audience. How are they reacting to your tirade? Are people walking away or are they cheering? Perhaps you need to let someone else have a turn at the microphone.
 ----- 
 In an attempt to merge with infinity, you might overlook some basic life principles, Libra. Be careful about being seduced by those who want you to be involved in their drama. You might willingly acquiesce at first. You may not even realize how deep a hole you've dug until it's too late. Make sure you haven't alienated everyone so that there's still someone left to dig you out.
 ----- 
 Feel free to stand up for yourself, a cause, or another person today, even if you know it will cause tension among the others around you. A heated argument is likely to ensue, and it wouldn't be surprising if you were the catalyst. Passionate debates are right up your alley, so use this as an opportunity to demonstrate your courage and strength in what you believe.
 ----- 
 Your mind is apt to be fixed on one thing today, Sagittarius, and you won't rest until you've obtained it. Perhaps it's a physical place you're trying to get to, a new gadget that you want to own, or a person you'd like to get to know better. Don't be surprised if you have to put up a bit of a fight in order to accomplish this goal, whatever it may be.
 ----- 
 Things may happen right under your nose today, Capricorn, and you may not even be aware of it. The thing that will be obvious is your reaction to the situation when this hidden event suddenly comes to light. A passionate explosion is likely, due to people's heightened emotional state. Try to work with this energy instead of against it.
 ----- 
 It could be that close friends or family members are in sharp disagreement regarding a certain issue, Aquarius. Try not to be too distressed by divisions among the people you love. Some may want you to take sides and express yourself fully on the situation. You may feel as if you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. Try your best to compromise.
 ----- 
 There is a great deal of emotion and drive to the day, just the way you like it, Pisces. Make sure you don't get stuck with the short end of the stick as the day comes to a close. An honest fight or debate is one thing, but a harsh manipulation of people is another. Make sure you're involved in the former and not the latter.
 ----- 
 Are you tired, Aries? It's no wonder. You're so eager to be useful that you've run yourself ragged over the past few weeks. As you may have noticed, the world is so apathetic now that every movement requires enormous effort on your part. Why not settle down and rest today? That would be the wisest and most reasonable thing to do. You will still be needed tomorrow.
 ----- 
 The planets are moving you into a new cycle, Taurus. Soon you will be in a new "story." You will have to take stock of what you've learned in previous weeks. Who you are is related to the degree of peace you have in your life and whether or not you've been able to resolve some conflicts. Did you learn your lessons well? Without a doubt, you have a gift for calming tense situations.
 ----- 
 Have you done the cleaning that the planetary configurations asked you to do in recent weeks, Gemini? If this is the case, today you should start to feel less weighed down by the conventions in your life. You've undoubtedly solved some of the problems in your relationships. You will feel as if you're in a kind of renaissance through the next cycle.
 ----- 
 The social agitation that has been in your life for the last three weeks is coming to an end, Cancer. The celestial energy will help you learn some lessons and prepare for the next cycle. It would be great if you had some success and honors because this would help you confront the coming weeks. It will be a time of meditation and feeling a little bit disconnected from the world.
 ----- 
 This is the end of the first stage in your "socialization," Leo. Are you satisfied with the people you've met? You can usually make the most out of these encounters, but did your political savvy let you down? Did it lead you in directions you didn't want to go? Take advantage of this pause to catch your breath and figure out where you are today and where you want to be tomorrow.
 ----- 
 This is the end of the voyage you've been on over the past few weeks, Virgo. You undoubtedly saw some interesting sights. Whether you were on an inner or outer voyage, the cosmic energy will bring you to a safe harbor. Unpack your bags carefully, as they're filled with treasures and souvenirs. You will want to put them around the house as happy reminders of how much you've grown.
 ----- 
 After the events of the last few weeks, do you still want to continue acting like the same person? This is always a good question to ask with a celestial atmosphere like today's. People generally feel that they have a chance to get out of old systems and relationships. But people always hesitate to do this because of a fear of the future. Don't waver. Take the next steps!
 ----- 
 The day ahead should give you an opportunity to analyze the events of the past three weeks, Scorpio. You will draw many important conclusions about your love life. You may conclude that matters have evolved little, if at all. This is discouraging, to be sure, but don't place too much trust in appearances. Remember, things aren't always as they seem.
 ----- 
 If you feel as though you aren't making sufficient progress toward your goals, use this day to correct your aim. Are you disappointed with your love life? You may have devoted a great deal of energy to it lately without seeing much payoff. Wait a few more days before you make any drastic decisions about the future, Sagittarius.
 ----- 
 Are you feeling somewhat annoyed today? This is hardly surprising since the day inspires you to take a long, hard look at what's happening with your life. It's as though you suddenly realize that decisions you make may have impacts that reach far and wide. But don't let that stop you from committing yourself to a course of action, Capricorn. Be adventurous!
 ----- 
 Are you feeling scattered, Aquarius? It's possible that you're wondering about a million different things today. Are you strong enough to assume your family duties? Are you attractive? Are you important? Of course, all these questions simply distract you from your anxiety. Don't worry. The next few weeks will be less stressful.
 ----- 
 Perhaps you notice some weariness today, Pisces. You have been much more active than usual for the past few weeks. You've been communicating with new people, having new experiences, attending virtual meetings, and perhaps even taking short trips. In the long run, will any of it further your goals? That's the question you have to answer today.
 ----- 
 The latest equipment might suddenly be available to you. It's likely to make life easier and more interesting. It could also open doors to make new friends and find new opportunities. Increased income is also a possibility. You could stumble on some surprising information, Aries, and this could set your mind going in a new direction. Today promises a lot of stimulation.
 ----- 
 Friends or a group could bring new and exciting information your way, perhaps involving career or educational opportunities. You might explore combining artistic talents with modern technology. Invitations to related social events could follow. Accept as many as you can, Taurus. They could make a difference in your personal, professional, and creative lives.
 ----- 
 Today you could decide to host a virtual party or small meeting in your home. You miss having a lot of visitors. This should be an exciting occasion, Gemini, and you could go out of your way to make this the best small event possible. It will probably be worth it. This event could bring people and information your way that make a big difference to you.
 ----- 
 Vast amounts of information could come to you through email or phone. Expect to hear from groups. You could make new friends, Cancer, possibly in your neighborhood, as changes could be taking place in your community. You could hear of online classes you want to take. Books or magazines may bring valuable information. This could be a very stimulating and significant day.
 ----- 
 Have you been thinking about expanding your computer skills? If so, this is the day to do it. You're likely to discover a lot of valuable information, as well as shortcuts for accomplishing your goals. Happiness reigns in the home as family members exchange a lot of new and interesting ideas. This could be a very gratifying day in a lot of ways, Leo.
 ----- 
 Social events, possibly involving small groups, could put you in touch with knowledgeable people who could provide valuable information. You might decide to go back to school or otherwise advance your education. Technology could play a large part in all this, Virgo, so it might be a good idea to work on your computer skills and bring them up to snuff. A short trip could be in the offing.
 ----- 
 Today your mind might be on social and political issues. If you aren't currently involved with groups dealing with these issues, you might consider joining one. A recent increase in income might have given you some extra time, and you may be excited about the possibilities. Service to others is one, Libra. Consider some others, perhaps developing a creative skill, before moving ahead.
 ----- 
 Information could come your way today that starts you thinking about new and revolutionary ideas. Perhaps they involve modern technology or social and political issues. Opportunities to meet new friends who share your interests could come through group activities. You should be feeling especially curious and optimistic about the future, Scorpio, and whatever exchanges with others you have are likely to set your mind buzzing.
 ----- 
 Unusual and unexpected opportunities to better your career could come to you today through friends. These friends could provide you with valuable information about making maximum use of your skills, Sagittarius. Efficiency could get a boost from technology. Expect a number of interesting communications, all bringing good news. This could prove to be a stimulating, exciting day.
 ----- 
 The possibility of taking a trip by air could present itself today. The trip might be made with friends or a small group, if possible. If you've been working on projects connected with education or publishing, this is the day to move them forward. Books, TV, and the Internet could bring interesting, valuable information your way. This promises to be a busy, stimulating day.
 ----- 
 The possibility to advance your career through increasing your technological skills may present itself today. This could open doors for you in a lot of directions, paving the way for increased income. A number of new contacts could come into your life, bringing friendship and opportunities. This is the day to work on building your skills and possibly return to school.
 ----- 
 A number of social invitations could come your way today, possibly connected with groups you're affiliated with. Accept as many as you can handle, Pisces; you should have a wonderful time, learn much that fascinates you, and make some new friends. A surprise encounter with a friend or your romantic partner could bring you closer together. This may be a significant day for you.
 ----- 
 It seems that the new planetary lineup has just opened up some doors that had previously been shut. You revel in the confidence that people have in you. It isn't that your abilities have changed, just your attitude! People trust you because you exhibit more self
 ----- 
 There is a possibility that you feel cheated or taken advantage of in some way. Do you feel as if you're paying more than your fair share? The day ahead gives you an opportunity to achieve recognition for your efforts and perhaps redress some grievances. It's odd that despite your tendency to espouse fairness, you feel uncomfortable when the authorities rule in your favor.
 ----- 
 You're gifted at bringing people together, there's no doubt about that, Gemini. Today will be especially good for participating in or initiating group activities. It's a favorable day for any project related to fellowship and assistance. You might do the groundwork to form a team, discussion group, or charitable endeavor.
 ----- 
 You have a promising day ahead, Cancer. Finally, you will advance by leaps and bounds in whatever needs to be done. Whatever has been causing the delays will likely be revealed today. You return to the skill and professionalism you so value after several weeks of halting progress. Don't tolerate any violation of your ethics now or in the future.
 ----- 
 There's some likelihood that something you need or want has been eluding your grasp. The somewhat strained aspect of the heavens lately hasn't helped. But today everything is within reach, especially if it was material considerations holding you back. You have an auspicious day ahead, so make the most of it!
 ----- 
 The day ahead will be a soothing one, Virgo. Since it's auspicious for the material aspect of things, it's a good time to settle household issues like bills or repairs. But you might also take advantage of today's aspect to set in motion even more ambitious plans about your living situation. Is it time to think more seriously about that move you've been dreaming of?
 ----- 
 You will be full of ideas for improving your lifestyle, Libra, especially as it relates to your family. It's true that over the past few months you've experienced some hardships. You can breathe easier now. Whether it's for your career or home, today's initiatives are likely to bring great rewards. Take advantage of the atmosphere to put together a realistic plan for the future.
 ----- 
 Is discipline high on your list of priorities lately, Scorpio? You're undoubtedly trying to inject some order into your daily life, and your behavior could benefit from some adjustment as well. Whether it concerns food, hygiene, or simply the intensity of your daily rhythm, it's possible that you will notice a real improvement today.
 ----- 
 You can expect your mood to improve today, Sagittarius. The professional and private projects that you have at the moment should be progressing well. You feel reassured, and you're encouraged to make some new plans. If you continue to keep up the good rhythm, you will have success in redefining your goals and life direction.
 ----- 
 Some people say that you miss out on life because of your tendency to observe your life rather than experience life directly. If that's the case, then today will be a real departure for you. You will suddenly seem more in contact with your sentiments and be more present and connected to those around you. It feels good for a change, doesn't it?
 ----- 
 Today, Aquarius, you're in the mood for commitment! Take time to connect with the social world as you seek like
 ----- 
 Your scattered energy comes together today in a powerful laser beam of concentrated attention and effort. You will work until you drop, and no one and nothing had better get in your way! Keep up the good pace. You're going to feel more loved than usual, and this changes absolutely everything for you.
 ----- 
 You can never be anyone other than who you are, Aries! That's the way it is, and you can't change it. Other members of your family may have dreamed of getting free of a duty or a moral lesson, but these dreams don't apply to you. Your dreams of being someone else are like phantoms that have come back to haunt you. Simply brush them away!
 ----- 
 The day ahead may bring a storm of individualism and independence. You usually tolerate the quirks and minor shortcomings of your friends or family members, but today they present real obstacles to your relationships. The only way to remedy the situation is to go on vacation. Spending some time alone will keep you out of trouble.
 ----- 
 If you want to make the best of the day ahead, Gemini, try to convince your team or family to work together. This is tricky to do, what with everyone's schedule being so demanding right now. Hard as it is to coordinate their efforts and orchestrate harmony, the strength of your character and your team spirit will make it all work out.
 ----- 
 The day ahead won't be easy, Cancer. A glimpse at your love life reveals that you will be bridling at certain inhibitions. You long for peace and stability, and at the moment everything is in suspense. Use the day ahead to gain some perspective on the situation. Until the ice melts and the flow of events resumes, why not devote your energy to some other endeavor?
 ----- 
 Lately, you've been nursing a feeling that your partner is inattentive. The tension has been building up and today, Leo, you're likely to boil over with the rage that comes from one too many doubts and suspicions. The forecast for love is stormy, without a doubt. But making up after the quarrel promises to be lots of fun.
 ----- 
 Some days it's better to be on vacation! That's what you're liable to think today. All your projects are mired in quicksand, and you feel like you're spinning your wheels. But even if things are momentarily stuck, don't lose faith. Your inner self is gaining stability. When the time is right, it will be strong and reliable.
 ----- 
 Deep inside, don't you have an urge to breathe new spirit into your love life? Of course, some things are more easily said than done. Currently, you don't have much time to devote to yourself, much less your partner. Affection could thrive if given half a chance. The day suggests that you commit yourself to making some decisions that will help bring you and your mate closer.
 ----- 
 It's time to get what you need, Scorpio. Your desires don't always go in a direction that does you the most good, and this can cause tension. You feel as though it's impossible to combine your desires with what is good for you, notably in your love life. You wrestle with whether you should remain in your "creative" cave or share your life with someone. It doesn't have to be one or the other.
 ----- 
 Take cover, Sagittarius, because today promises to be an emotional roller coaster! Something seems to be askew with your relationships, and you feel torn in opposite directions. One force is pushing you to enrich your inner universe and another force is pushing you into the arms of someone you've recently met. Stay busy to avoid confrontation.
 ----- 
 People are going to think you're a star today, Capricorn! Although you may not feel that way about yourself. What's gotten into you lately? Have you lost confidence in yourself? Are you now compensating for it? Do you feel a need for more success in your life? All this is possible, but you will have to take some risks if you're going to progress.
 ----- 
 Stop asking if you're gifted, Aquarius. This definitely isn't the time for such questions. Now is the time to work on something concrete. You will need the help of others if you're to succeed, so get to work convincing them to ally with you. You may have to reveal more of yourself than you normally do in order to sway people to your side. It's time to get out of your hole and take action!
 ----- 
 A partner for life or a brief encounter, which will it be? This is today's question. Why not choose both? Can you imagine being your partner's lover while keeping your independence? Don't be influenced by old models that force you to choose between these two ideas. Don't forget that in our modern world, your choices aren't as limited as you might think!
 ----- 
 You may have had some emotional disappointments lately, but today will restore your faith in love. All you need to do is act. Your amazing lucidity and realism keep you from hoping for the impossible. You'd rather go to work to attain your goals than dilly
 ----- 
 Put on your traveling shoes, Taurus. Fear of the unknown may have prompted you to postpone certain trips. You claimed you were too busy, but no one really believed this, not even you. If an opportunity to travel presents itself today, don't pass it up. It's silly to avoid life.
 ----- 
 Something is currently compelling you to be more of a world citizen than usual, Gemini. You may find this somewhat disturbing. You feel as though the roots of your identity, such as your family background and social standing, are dissolving little by little. Comfort yourself with the knowledge that your family is simply changing and expanding. It will stabilize again on another, higher plane.
 ----- 
 Your surroundings are currently changing, Cancer. Perhaps your circle of friends has already undergone a major change. The fact is that you no longer have so many prejudices about the people you meet, and no longer seek only a certain type of person as a friend. You accept whoever comes along. You may not realize it, but your attitude is completely different now than it once was. Good for you!
 ----- 
 Leo, you're demystifying the concept of talent. You used to look enviously at other people and think, "I wish I had a natural ability like that." Now you understand that the person who aroused your envy with is just someone who had the self
 ----- 
 Are you thinking of going into business for yourself, Virgo? Being self
 ----- 
 Within the next few days, you're likely to gain access to dimensions of perception you never suspected, Libra. Perhaps you will become aware of certain energy phenomena, peak experiences, or other highly sensitive states of consciousness. Don't be frightened. Instead, investigate what these worlds have to offer. What you learn will help you cope with your sensitivity.
 ----- 
 Often fiery temperaments like yours are drawn to fight for great causes despite the better judgment of more down
 ----- 
 Your optimism is likely to receive a little boost today, Sagittarius. A memorable emotional encounter may be the source of some extra zeal. Or you may derive great satisfaction from being part of a group. The nagging chores of daily life will be forgotten for today at least. The outlook is nothing but positive!
 ----- 
 Perhaps you should suspend your inhibitions for the day, Capricorn, and let your dreams guide you. For instance, you might imagine that the need to make any choices has vanished. Or you might grant yourself a vacation from daily chores. It would certainly be a relief. Who knows? You might conjure up some reality from the stuff of your dreams.
 ----- 
 This is the type of day you enjoy. The climate is positive, and the energy is flowing. It's as though you have a magic wand. You give it a wave and 
 ----- 
 If the world collapsed today, you wouldn't bat an eyelash. You're perfectly content sailing along on cloud nine! The source of your bliss could be that new person in your life. Are you passionately, intensely, wonderfully in love? You can yield to the magic. Let it bring out the positive parts of your personality but keep your wits about you all the same!
 ----- 
 You may be feeling emotionally good, Aries, but unfortunately the people around you don't seem to share this feeling. Your first instinct may be to sacrifice yourself in order to make the path easier for the next guy. Remember that other people need to learn how to do things on their own. If someone is in a bad mood, let them be in a bad mood. You may be better off spending the day alone.
 ----- 
 There's an advantage to joining people in a social or family situation if possible, Taurus. Your role today is to bridge communication gaps. Be aware of details that need doing, but don't feel like you have to do them all yourself. This is a good time to delegate responsibility. Keep track of who is in charge of what or you could end up taking up the slack for a job that someone else is supposed to do.
 ----- 
 Calm down and get organized before you spread your ideas to others, Gemini. This is especially true when it comes to love and romance. As soon as this topic comes up, you tense up and erupt inappropriately. Ground yourself and find your center of balance 
 ----- 
 You've reached a climactic time of year regarding love and romance, Cancer. This is the time when your dream finally materializes, or you realize that all your efforts are failures. It all depends on how you played your cards over the past few months. This is one of those moments of reckoning when you face reality. You must bring your craft to the landing strip and check in with mission control.
 ----- 
 Your emotions are solid, and you feel good, Leo. At the same time, you may be tongue
 ----- 
 Matters of love and romance should be going well, but try not to overdo it, Virgo. Be careful of getting so caught up in the fantasy of romance that you fail to take care of the details. Today is a good day to get the foundation solid before you start building. If you've already started building, you may need to stand back and consider areas in which some extra support beams may be necessary.
 ----- 
 This is one of those days when the road forks in several directions and you must decide which way to go, Libra. This usually isn't hard. You just go with the flow. But now things are flowing in multiple directions and you need to figure out which way to go. Stick with the way that seems most natural. Remember that whatever choice you make will be the right one.
 ----- 
 Your plane is fueled, your bags packed, and you have clearance from the control tower, but for some reason, Scorpio, you just can't seem to get off the ground. Perhaps there are details of the trip that you haven't taken into account. People are firing questions at you, and you don't have all the answers. This is especially true when it comes to matters of love and romance.
 ----- 
 The person who is most organized and stable will win the race, so let it be you, Sagittarius. Be careful, though. Other people may try to distract you from your work. You may be in the middle of an important project and decide to take a break. Before you know it, the phone rings and suddenly you're trapped with no escape. The break that you hoped would take no more than five minutes has turned into a big interruption.
 ----- 
 Your brain is buzzing in high gear, Capricorn. Anyone else would get dizzy trying to process even a fraction of the things that filter through your head in one day. The key for you is to not speak every single thought aloud but to keep your processing internal. People want to hear your final decision, not the process you went through to reach it. You will save everyone a lot of time if you do.
 ----- 
 You may have a hard time relating to people in social situations, Aquarius. Perhaps you're frustrated at hearing the same shallow conversations over and over. While you have to mingle (even virtually) with different people, all you can think about is how nice it would be if you could be alone in front of the TV. Your best plan is to avoid situations that you know you won't enjoy. There's no sense in torturing yourself.
 ----- 
 Things have probably been going well lately in the love and romance department, Pisces. You find that communication has improved, and the witty banter is invigorating and educational. Today there may be a blip on the radar. You may have been so caught up in the good parts that you failed to take care of the details and do the actual work needed to make things run smoothly.
 ----- 
 If you're feeling irritable and wrung out today, Aries, it may be a result of putting far too much pressure on yourself. It might be wise to take a look at the expectations you have of yourself. Consider if you would you place the same demands on those closest to you. If the answer is no, it's time to revamp your life to suit the one you're closest to 
 ----- 
 Consider whether or not you're spending enough time with everyone who's special to you, Taurus. If more hours are going to work colleagues, friends, or partner, there might be an imbalance that you need to look at. Sit down and create a chart of where your time has gone lately. If one portion is considerably larger than the others, make a point of spending some time with the people represented by the smaller portions.
 ----- 
 If your partner acts quickly on his or her passions today, Gemini, you will probably want to slow things down a bit. "Nice and easy" is the phrase of the day for you, so create an environment that will allow for more time in such circumstances. Let your partner know how you feel and what you'd like to see happen. No one is a mind reader. There's far less chance of any misunderstanding when there is open communication.
 ----- 
 Consider planning a romantic interlude, Cancer. With the influence from today's planetary aspects, it will be easy to connect with that special someone. Make dinner with your spouse or partner or make a date with someone new who's caught your eye, if possible. Don't let shyness or insecurity stand in your way. If you're single, consider loving the most important person in your life 
 ----- 
 If someone takes too long to do something today, Leo, your temper may flare up. Patience isn't always your strong suit, and you may believe in the "if you want it done right, do it yourself" philosophy. This isn't always fair. Others need to do things at their own pace, and in some cases, it's essential that you give them the room to do so. Take a deep breath if you have to, and be patient.
 ----- 
 You might find it rather tough to take criticism today, Virgo. This is something that's hard for many to hear, but it truly depends on your perspective. Rather than view it as a personal attack, try to see the value in the criticism. If you're honest with yourself and recognize that you could learn and grow from critique, seize it as an opportunity. If you find that it's out in left field, then leave it there.
 ----- 
 Be careful not to fall prey to your own idealism today, Libra. While this is one of your most admirable qualities, as it contributes to your romantic, creative nature, too much of anything can be harmful. It's important to see things as they are, despite how much you may wish them to be different. The real world doesn't always go hand in hand with your ideal place. If something feels off, it probably is. Trust your instincts.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if you feel a real need for some breathing room today, Scorpio. As much as you enjoy the company of others, you need to have time to yourself as well. See if you can work in a private space or simply shut your door. If you need to move in order to be alone, hop in the car and go. Irritability is a good indicator of when you need to get away from the crowd.
 ----- 
 If things haven't been going too well with those you spend most of your time with, Sagittarius, it might be time to consider your expectations of them. Ask what kinds of demands you place on others and if they're fair. Is it possible that you expect the same from others that you give, but perhaps they aren't able to match your level of performance? Consider talking with the people involved to find out how they feel.
 ----- 
 A little romantic time with your special someone may be in order today, Capricorn. With the day
 ----- 
 Take it slow and easy today, Aquarius. With the energy from the day's aspects, rushing around isn't likely to get you too far. In fact, you're more apt to make mistakes or leave a bunch of things unfinished. Make your to
 ----- 
 It may be time to look at where you are in life, Pisces. Are you where you thought you'd be? If so, congratulations. This is a real accomplishment. If not, take heart. Many people discover that they aren't anywhere close. The key is to write down solid goals and the steps needed to reach them. It's your life after all. Mapping out your route is up to you.
 ----- 
 Be tactful when speaking today, Aries. With this day's energy, it's important that you take the time to think about how your words affect the person you're talking to. It can be easier than usual to say the wrong thing, especially if you're in the position of telling someone something you think might not go over too well. Avoid comments that suggest criticism of the person rather than the deed.
 ----- 
 Today, Taurus, don't be too surprised if you have difficulty getting into a work frame of mind. It's likely that you'd rather daydream than be in the real world. You're susceptible to daydreaming and taking imaginative trips. Consider making a list of everything that you need to do to help you focus. This will help you meet your short
 ----- 
 You may find today that people are really attracted to you as a friend. This is because you're usually a good listener. You're open to other people's ideas and thoughts and can care easily. Consider noticing those around you to see if there isn't someone who could use an ear to listen to a problem. It may not take a lot to get someone talking.
 ----- 
 It's good to dream, especially on days like today, Cancer. Expanding your mind and thinking of possibilities are positive ways to increase your knowledge. Give yourself time to think. Why not lie on your back and watch the clouds or stars? Let yourself dream about things that may not seem practical or possible. Many real things have come out of someone's dreams. Your creativity will flourish if you take the time.
 ----- 
 With today's energy, you might want to let your imagination run free for a while, Leo. This can add a real boost, as it will connect you with your inner self. Let your imagination be your ticket to your creative and artistic abilities. Problem
 ----- 
 Today you may meet a new friend, Virgo. People tend to feel comfortable around you even if they're different than you are. That's because you usually accept the fact that everyone is different and that's OK. This is a rare and special quality 
 ----- 
 You have an incredible imagination, Libra. Today is a great day to put it to use. Take time to engage in creative activities and try meditation, story planning, role playing, or visualization. You have a powerful tool to unlock inner fears and inhibitions, increasing your confidence and creativity and solving life's challenges. If this is a new idea for you, consider learning more about meditation to connect with your inner self.
 ----- 
 Chances are good that you will feel strong and confident today, Scorpio. It's a good time to try something you've never done before. You might be the right person to get things started, especially if it's about something you want to see changed. If you've never run for office before or taken a leadership role in another area, consider doing this. You have the power and popularity to make a real difference.
 ----- 
 The energy of the day should have you feeling pretty good, Sagittarius. Your spirits should be high, and laughing may well be a good part of your day. When you laugh, it gets other people going. This is a powerful effect to have. You may find that you can transfer the enthusiasm and good feelings you have to those around you. Share your positive energy by smiling, laughing, and just being yourself.
 ----- 
 Expect a boost in popularity today, Capricorn. One way to put this to good use is to bring about change. Perhaps you and your co
 ----- 
 Today's energy may highlight your popularity, Aquarius. The transits boost your enthusiasm and energy for doing things. People will feel drawn to you. You might even find that others look up to you. This kind of popularity can make you feel special and lucky. On the flip side, it can make you think you're better than you are. Don't get carried away. Use this influence for good.
 ----- 
 Today should present a very positive influence for you, Pisces. The energy at play will allow for such things as making excellent decisions. Things will go more quickly than usual. Cooperation from colleagues, physical energy, and a sharp mind will support you. What more could you ask? You may find that almost everything goes your way and laughter fills the hours. Give yourself a pat on the back because you should be able to handle everything.
 ----- 
 Today you might feel inspired to help others less fortunate, Aries. The opportunity to do some volunteer work could come your way, perhaps for a church, charity, or other humanitarian organization. Or you could throw yourself into an artistic discipline. Either way, you're likely to enjoy yourself immensely and meet some interesting people in the process. Fundraising could be involved in some way.
 ----- 
 Creativity and romance are the words for today, Taurus. Artistic or other creative projects are likely to catch the attention of others, perhaps bringing valuable contacts your way. As a result, you're likely to be inspired to move ahead to new ones. You're also likely to feel especially romantic and sexy. If you're currently involved, expect to grow closer to your partner. If you aren't, you might meet someone special.
 ----- 
 A group of people oriented toward artistic, spiritual, or humanitarian pursuits could meet virtually today to work on advancing their projects. Among them could be someone very special who might play a positive role in your life. As a result of this gathering you could find inspiration to move ahead with personal projects. In the evening, watch a romantic movie or talk to someone youre attracted to!
 ----- 
 Errands or other short journeys in your neighborhood could result in a chance meeting with someone who could be of great benefit to you in the future, Cancer. Opportunities to advance your educational, artistic, or spiritual interests could open up as a result of this meeting. When you go out, make sure you look your best even if you're only going to the grocery store.
 ----- 
 Today you might hear of opportunities to make extra money through creative work of some kind, Leo. This could be a genuine lucky break achieved by being in the right place at the right time. You will probably take advantage of it, because right now you're full of inspiration. You might have a hard time keeping track of all your ideas. Write them down!
 ----- 
 Today you should be looking and feeling great. You might attract some admiring looks from passersby on the street. Sex and romance might be on your mind, Virgo. You're likely to want to spend the day with your special someone. You could also channel those feelings into creative activities of some kind. Information may come your way that sets your mental juices flowing. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Your mind is full of wonderful thoughts today, Libra. You might consider spending the day meditating, doing some volunteer work, or turning your inspiration into an artistic project of some kind. Your intuition is especially high, so you might tune in more acutely than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others. Take a few minutes during the day to be alone with your thoughts. You will probably benefit from it.
 ----- 
 A desire to be creative could have you experimenting with various kinds of artistic disciplines, perhaps in connection with computers, Scorpio. At some point today you could be in the right place at the right time, receiving just the right help from someone who can point you in whatever direction you want to go. Ambitious plans could fill your head and keep your mind buzzing. Make a list! It might help.
 ----- 
 Artistic inspiration could come from deep within at some point today, perhaps even from a dream or vision. You're likely to have a lot of energy to pour into creativity right now, Sagittarius, and if you work hard and don't lose sight of the business side of the arts, you could move forward. Don't be surprised if you suddenly meet the right person to give you the right advice!
 ----- 
 Today you might toy with the idea of publishing, exhibiting, or otherwise making public whatever creative innovations you've been working on, Capricorn. Spiritual information could come your way from afar, perhaps through friends or a group with which you're affiliated. Inspiration of all kinds could pop in and out of your head, so it might be best to write down your thoughts.
 ----- 
 Inspiration in various contexts could fill your mind today, Aquarius. Opportunities to advance your artistic or spiritual interests could come your way, perhaps through advice given by a new acquaintance. You could also be in the right place at the right time to get a lucky break. You're likely to feel especially romantic and sexy. You might want to celebrate your good fortune by getting together with your partner.
 ----- 
 Social events with artistically or spiritually inclined people could have you feeling especially inspired, Pisces, and looking forward to the future in whatever discipline interests you. You're also likely to be feeling especially romantic and sexy. You will want to schedule time alone with that special someone in your life. If you aren't currently involved, you could meet someone special today.
 ----- 
 Your intuition should be very high right now, Aries, as is your power of manifestation. Today you need to try to curb your thoughts and only think beautiful things, because you might find that whatever you think about seems to manifest! Some powerful dreams and visions can open up new lines of intellectual exploration for you that can have a potent effect on your immediate future. Go to it.
 ----- 
 Your immediate goals and wishes might suddenly appear to come together today, seemingly of their own accord. This might be strange, Taurus, and perhaps a bit frightening, but your inner power is especially strong now, and your higher self is manifesting what you've worked long and hard to achieve. At times like this, it's important to remember those who helped you along the way. You will want to acknowledge them as well as yourself.
 ----- 
 If you've been working toward manifesting extra money in your life, Gemini, you will probably see it happen today. Copious physical and emotional energy gives your inner power of mind over matter a special impetus, and you might see the results you've wanted in finance and other matters. Professional interests should also be going well, as well as any personal projects. Keep up the good work!
 ----- 
 Obstacles that you encountered in attaining your cherished goals could suddenly seem to melt away, clearing the way to make your dreams come true, Cancer. This could involve physical health, plans for future travel and education, and self
 ----- 
 A lot of activity could occur at home today, Leo. Perhaps you will have visitors or do some work on the house. Your intuition is particularly strong right now, and you could pick up too much of the thoughts and feelings of others, even strangers. You will probably be most in tune with your family. Take care to guard your thoughts. Today you might find that whatever you think of could actually manifest.
 ----- 
 Whatever goals you've been trying to reach may finally become reality today, Virgo. Finalizing everything could involve a lot of running around in the car and meeting with other people, but you're likely to feel exhilarated all the same. Powerful people could prove to be of valuable help to you. As a result, matters should be going very well right now. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Events over which you seem to have no control seem to be coming together to make things happen for you, Libra. You might find this a bit frightening, but don't let it get to you. Go with the flow. You've worked hard for what's happening today, and you deserve to enjoy the results. The exhilaration you feel could manifest as abundant physical energy. This could be too much of a good thing. Don't overdo.
 ----- 
 Your energy is probably high today, almost to the point where you feel you might be able to run a marathon! Seriously, Scorpio, you're probably thinking in terms of getting out of town for a while. Exercising or participating in solo sports could also be appealing. You might direct some of this energy into creative projects. Take care not to overdo it. You could still get too tired.
 ----- 
 Your inner power is probably at an all
 ----- 
 Some fascinating conversations with friends, relatives, and others close to you could take place today, bringing new ideas your way, Capricorn. You have both the physical energy and the inner power to make things happen, so you should make the most of it. Carefully consider your needs and aspirations and formulate a plan of action to make them a reality. The results might surprise you!
 ----- 
 Your career and financial goals should be within your grasp, Aquarius. Both your physical energy and inner power are operating at their peak, making this an ideal day to make clear plans. Also, if you've been working to improve your health, you might see some definite results. If not, this is a great day to start a new health and exercise regimen. Go to it!
 ----- 
 Today you're likely to feel like the powerful creature you are, Pisces. Your physical energy is high, and you look and feel great. Your intellect is sharp, so if you indulge in any kind of learning process, you will benefit greatly. Your creative energy is also high, so it's a good day to work on artistic projects. In the evening, you will feel especially romantic, so plan an intimate encounter with a special someone!
 ----- 
 As a Aries, you have an innate gift for healing and calming other people in crisis situations. If this isn't what you do for a living, you should think about doing something with this natural talent. The positions of the planets today may be telling you to think about this in more concrete terms. If you're interested in herbal therapy, for example, this could be the perfect time to learn more.
 ----- 
 You seem to be a specialist at relationships, and you're very sensitive to the ups and downs in your own. But today you may wonder if people love you less than they did before. This is rather an odd question, but another one may be hiding underneath. Do you really have to make such a big effort in order to be loved? Only you can answer that question.
 ----- 
 You're usually full of energy, Gemini, but today you may not feel so vivacious. There's nothing to worry about. In fact, you may have the time to do some thinking about your personal life and what you expect to get out of your relationships. You might also want to think about how you intend to go about getting it! Perhaps some of your motivations have changed lately.
 ----- 
 You may have had a hard time lately reaching your objectives. Unfortunately for you, Cancer, today will be no different. You may begin to feel a bit dissatisfied with the way your life is going at the moment. You will ask yourself certain questions about your goals. Does your personal life live up to those goals? Can you express your wonderful creativity as much as you'd like?
 ----- 
 Your sense of responsibility is probably the catalyst for most of your motivation, Leo. But what happens when events are beyond your control and you're powerless to do anything about them? You may have to admit that sometimes you can't control everything, especially your family and friends. Today you should think about letting things happen occasionally. Your life will be a lot less complicated.
 ----- 
 Today you could put a stop to your activities for a little while, Virgo. You may take a good, hard look at things and realize that the climate of trust you need in order to be productive and creative is missing at the moment. It's a good time to get some order back into your relationships and remind others of their responsibilities to you.
 ----- 
 What are you after in life, Libra? Deep down, does the kind of work you do satisfy your most intimate desires? The little problems you encounter in your professional life over the next week could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Take a look around to see if the work you do and the people in your life take your profoundly spiritual nature into account.
 ----- 
 It's possible that you're trying to do too much, Scorpio. If look at the days you spend working, you may realize that too much of your energy goes to some very meager results. Today, consider taking some time off to take advantage of life. Why not go out for a nice dinner with friends, or even better, go on a little vacation? Try and let things happen. You deserve time just for you!
 ----- 
 It's possible that you could be in conflict with people of the opposite sex today, Sagittarius. You may feel as if they put obstacles in front of you and slow you down. But instead of getting into conflicts that could eventually escalate into full
 ----- 
 You have a very dynamic day ahead of you, Capricorn. You may feel the need to put all your energy into a group project. You will want to roll up your sleeves and get to work. You're usually a meditative, pensive person, but today you're looking for concrete results and actions. Who knows? This hard work might even help you relax a little.
 ----- 
 Have you ever thought of yourself as a CEO or any other kind of leader, Aquarius? Today is a great day to begin a project involving other people 
 ----- 
 There's a lot of tension in the air today, Pisces. Perhaps you feel like no one is listening to you, and that people are draining your energy. You may act defensively and even occasionally become very angry. It's possible that no one has seen in you in such a state before. Don't be afraid to express your anger. Repressed anger is like poison for your body and soul.
 ----- 
 Have fun with loved ones, Aries. Put your worries aside. Don't think of the possible negative consequences of having a good time. Focus on the fun and excitement of the moment. You have the ability to create fantastically strong bonds between you and your romantic partner. Love is in your favor, so act with confidence. There is no reason to feel bad or insecure in any way. Hold your head high.
 ----- 
 You're the secret jewel, Taurus. You're apt to be extremely loving and devoted to those who recognize this in you. There is no reason to shrink back and hide. Put on your royal air and flaunt your stuff. Your peaceful, charming nature shines through, and you radiate the god
 ----- 
 You may feel locked in a bind of deep emotion and stubborn attitudes with close friends or lovers, Gemini. Perhaps it's hard for you to say what you really feel. You may be under the impression that you're being tested and judged by everyone else. Try not to let your ego get in the way of a good time. Say what you feel without getting worried about how others will react.
 ----- 
 Your spirit sparkles, Cancer. You may feel filled with tremendous energy as you go about your day. Your sense of adventure is high, and there's very little that gets you down. One area that might be difficult to deal with right now is love and romance. You may feel like this is the one domain in which things aren't going the way you'd like them to. Patience is the secret.
 ----- 
 You may feel yourself slipping into a deeper understanding with a close friend or loved one, Leo. Romantic situations are heating up, and you're slowly letting your inhibitions fade away so they're completely absent. You realize the exuberance and excitement that come when you come out of hiding and let your playful spirit charm the world. Put serious subjects aside and make time to have fun and be more social.
 ----- 
 Most of the time it's good to have strong opinions and be independent and willful, Virgo. But there are other times when this attitude turns people away you're hoping to draw closer. There's a stubborn yet sensitive attitude in your world of romance that may be difficult for you to deal with. Perhaps you're taking a more rational approach to things while your loved one is taking a more emotional one.
 ----- 
 Sensual, passionate lovemaking is definitely on the agenda of activities for tonight, Libra. Fun, excitement, romance, and love are all key themes likely to take precedence if you have anything to say about it 
 ----- 
 You may feel like the brakes have been slammed in the romance department, Scorpio. Realize that this doesn't mean you have to stop having fun. Laughter and good times are in store for you today as long as you don't get hung up on the slow pace of your love life. You can have a good time while taking things one step at a time. Savor each moment. Don't try to rush to the next.
 ----- 
 The stars indicate that love and romance are in your favor, Sagittarius. You will find that this area of your life is going well. Shower your partner with affection. You honey's ego needs to be stroked. However, don't spoil him or her to the point that your mate becomes self
 ----- 
 Your sensitive, sensual side is being drawn out, Capricorn. You may feel like your romantic side is on display. You're like a dancer onstage, and you accept this role with pleasure! There's a great combination of energies at work letting you become more realistic about love and approach it with dramatic flair and courage. Be more expressive when it comes to your needs and desires.
 ----- 
 Come out of your shell and be proud of your sensitive side, Aquarius. Although you may feel vulnerable when it comes to love and romance, this doesn't mean that you have to hide it. You may think that everyone else has it together in this department, but don't be fooled. They're just as insecure as you are! Go ahead and let this side of your personality shine. Admitting your vulnerability is wonderfully attractive.
 ----- 
 You shouldn't have any problem getting your way in most areas of life, Pisces. The time is ripe for you to take the lead. Unfortunately, there may be one important part of your life that isn't going exactly to plan, and this is love and romance. It's likely that you will run into a tremendously stubborn attitude that you can't seem to break through. It could be your own.
 ----- 
 Today you may be feeling a little surer of yourself than usual. You can be fairly shy and reserved. Today you should try and make people a little more aware of you, to take you seriously. It's time that people respected you more, especially the people around you. Try to think of yourself before you think of other people. You're worth it!
 ----- 
 This would be an ideal day to think about your personal interests in all areas of your life, Taurus. You've surely noticed that in various relationships you tend not to consider yourself and what you get out of it. The configuration of the planets today can help you concentrate on yourself and think about what you give up in return for your need to please others.
 ----- 
 Gemini, don't be surprised if you meet people who are quite self
 ----- 
 Today could be rather constraining, Cancer. Despite your great aspirations, today will be marked by the need to take care of the small problems that arise in everyday life. In other words, just what you love. That said, being more down to Earth or in contact with the realities of the world can never do anything but good for you.
 ----- 
 Even if it's true in general that Leo have strong bodies like you, there are times when it's important that they take care of themselves. This would be an ideal day to be more aware of that fact. It isn't that you're going to have health problems. Rather, the planets are positioned in the middle of abundant activity, suggesting that you'd be wise to take care of your body 
 ----- 
 Today might be a little rough for you, Virgo. It's as if reality were waiting to trip you up. Nothing about you is realistic. If you're still a bit childish or irresponsible, today may be rather hard on you. It's nothing serious, so don't worry. However, if you feel as though your back is to the wall, don't react. Try to calmly accept what's happening to you.
 ----- 
 Here's a day that will be rather calm for you, Libra. Peace has replaced all your soul searching. You feel in contact with life's daily routine, including aspects that you don't always consider like the weather, people's expressions, or small coincidences. You seem to be floating on a cloud. You're going to have a good deal of confidence today!
 ----- 
 It's time to get yourself together. You tend to be all over the place. You need to channel your energies into something you really care about. Tell yourself how proud you would be if you could get this done. Don't give up and don't change directions on your way. Stay focused!
 ----- 
 Today you should think about your overdependence on money and material possessions, Sagittarius. Don't you think you spend too much of your precious time thinking about money and where you're going to find it? Are you careful with your money? Do you stick to or even have a budget? These are important questions, and this is a good day to find the answers.
 ----- 
 The last few weeks have been a little too serious for your tastes, but this is good for you every once in a while, Capricorn. You may tend to want to play, which sometimes keeps you from getting your work done. Take today to try and get your daily life organized so you can have time to take care of your responsibilities and have a little fun.
 ----- 
 Aquarius, you're someone who needs to have a lot of time to yourself. You often dream of curling up in bed with a good book or going for a bike ride. This is just your natural rhythm. Don't try and ignore it, because doing so could only mean problems for you. Give in from time to time. If you don't, at least use today to think about how you could.
 ----- 
 This will be a great day for you, Pisces. Everything you touch will seem to turn to gold. The day's events will fall right into place. You will take pleasure in being calm and efficient. But what you may not realize is that this could happen every day. Take the time to see what's going right today in order to make it happen again tomorrow!
 ----- 
 Obviously, you have an important role to play, Aries. The mood today may be somewhat frustrating, but the way you handle it will earn you rewards and recognition in your workplace or at school. Your strength, self
 ----- 
 You will feel as though your back is against the wall, Taurus. And this particular wall is impeding your progress. Others will ask you questions and ask for your opinion. You may want to tell them the "truth" as you understand it, and you could be tempted to do so humorously. Humor isn't your forte right now. You can always try, but for now a sensible approach is the best one.
 ----- 
 Today is likely to be a bit gray, Gemini. You won't be able to see how you can get out of your current situation. You may have some financial or physical problems at the moment. If this is the case, it's because you don't rely enough on your abilities and good sense to pull you through. It's possible that you don't take care of your body as well as you should. That's easily remedied.
 ----- 
 You're wasting your energy, Cancer, and you know it. You try your best to go about your everyday routine, but you're never really present. You listen to people but what they're saying doesn't interest you in any fundamental way. Yes, you're bored, and you're afraid to admit it to yourself. The depth of your inner search requires that you use a lot of energy to reexamine your life.
 ----- 
 It isn't always easy to think about how your life is going, Leo. Imagine if you were alone in the world, with nothing to hold you back or force you to do anything. At least once a month dedicate an hour to visualizing what your life would be like under these conditions. This will help you figure out what's impeding you today.
 ----- 
 Now is the time to be thinking about your professional orientation, Virgo. You may need to get some more fun in your life and experience pleasures that you've never had before. You have a certain tendency to separate the two worlds of work and play, but there's no need. In fact, your work will prosper once you discover ways to make it more playful.
 ----- 
 You may be worn out, Libra, but you will have to push forward anyway. You're entering a long period of work and perseverance. This definitely isn't the moment to be late or balk. If you're still in your pajamas at noon, you should be ashamed! Do what you can to wake yourself from your recent daze. It's time to get up and get moving!
 ----- 
 In a series of days that have tested your patience to the limit, here comes the moment of truth that could make or break you. You can expect a high
 ----- 
 Are you hankering for a little fun and longing for a little experimentation and perhaps even childish play? Tempting as these prospects are, you will have to ignore them. Sagittarius, you simply don't have the time, at least not today. You will be too busy coping with numerous little emergencies that crop up and having to justify your decisions throughout the day.
 ----- 
 Do you feel as though your self
 ----- 
 Is there someone persecuting you, Aquarius? Is there a situation that feels unbearably oppressive? Today you won't have any trouble identifying the source of your problems. And the great news is that is the first step toward obtaining release from them. But you can't expect it to be easy. The day ahead may feel somewhat overwhelming.
 ----- 
 Although your current mood is somewhat reserved and modest, you probably feel tempted to strut your stuff every once in a while. However, if you try to show off today, Pisces, you may not be very pleased with your reception. It's natural for you to want to impress people, but you must try to do it with genuine qualities and simplicity. That's true good taste!
 ----- 
 For the past several days, Aries, you've been fairly lucky in financial and material terms. But the day ahead will be an exception. If you're planning to make an investment, sign a contract, or purchase a major item, postpone it until another day. You may as well resign yourself to this fate and be grateful that you were spared the chance to make a mistake!
 ----- 
 The way you act when you first meet people is typical of Taurus. What is it that you do? You try to teach them something. It seems that you always have a lesson to impart, making you prone to giving advice when it isn't always wanted. Try to accept the points of view of others for a change.
 ----- 
 Your philosophy of life comes naturally, Gemini. Others need to study, listen to experts, or sign on to various allegiances. You, on the other hand, already have a profound outlook on life that you surely inherited from your past experiences. It would be interesting for you to expand on your philosophy a bit and try to turn it into something concrete.
 ----- 
 It isn't because your new projects demand such precision that they're causing you problems, Cancer. You tend to think details keep you from having a global vision, but that simply isn't true. There's no conflict between the long
 ----- 
 Yes, Leo, this is a good moment to abandon old beliefs and moral values. Your view of life has changed and, above all, you're more aware of how your outdated, preconceived ideas sometimes poison your life. The past no longer concerns you. It's time for you to make a clean break from the beliefs that are holding you back. You might shock your family, but they'll get over it.
 ----- 
 If you aren't careful to keep your eyes straight ahead and focused on the future, the past is likely to catch up to you, Virgo. Don't look back, even if you don't see anything in front of you. You must continue to move forward. It's true that this is easier said than done. Nevertheless, you feel inspired to give it a try.
 ----- 
 This would be the moment to say yes to your destiny, Libra. You're a little frustrated because things haven't been moving forward the way you'd like. But now that opportunities are coming your way, you find you're holding things up. You're just afraid, that's all. But rather than let your fear overtake you, turn its energy to your advantage.
 ----- 
 Don't expect to meet the partner of your dreams today, Scorpio. Rather, your romantic hopes are likely to meet with frustration. It would be better to devote your energies to something more realistic, such as your financial situation. It probably does need some attention, wouldn't you agree? If you redirect your energy, the rewards are more likely to be forthcoming.
 ----- 
 There's some likelihood that a recent meeting with an influential person has put a damper on your hopes for your projects. Will you abandon them and live with regret? Or will you choose to maintain your goals despite advice to the contrary and the risk of encountering disapproval from your supervisors? This is the type of question you will have to resolve today, Sagittarius.
 ----- 
 You will have to expect a few disturbances in the harmony that has reigned over the past few days, Capricorn. For example, your needs may not match those of your mate or close friends, or you may feel restless. Minor worries about the future may intrude on people's good moods. In short, this won't be a good day to look to emotional harmony as a source of satisfaction.
 ----- 
 As a person who embodies affection and tenderness, Aquarius, you may feel especially resentful about today's mood. It will be difficult to charm a smile out of anyone or achieve any semblance of harmony. Moreover, the friction won't spare siblings 
 ----- 
 A longing for comfort and the small, simple pleasures in life is likely to cripple your initiative today, Pisces. Have you decided to withdraw from the career world for the time being? Or perhaps you're just discouraged by the lack of enthusiasm in your colleagues. In any case, this would be a good day to stay home and rest, Pisces.
 ----- 
 This day isn't likely to be the highlight of your week, Aries. You may be aware of constraints at work or home. You're quite likely to hanker for an appropriate reward for your labor. Any type of recognition would be nice at this point. This is a good day to define new personal and professional goals. They'll sustain you through your unending chores.
 ----- 
 It may be that you've been a bit too stubborn lately. You've been doing whatever you want, giving no consideration to financial constraints. Now it's urgent that you take care of any unresolved monetary issues. You definitely have some lessons to learn in the area of fiscal responsibility, Taurus! Do what you can to raise your awareness.
 ----- 
 You may find yourself in a situation where you need to choose whether or not to commit to a relationship, Gemini. Old demons could come back to haunt you, renewing doubts and creating fears about a lack of freedom. Ignore these demons at all costs! If you give in to them, you're likely to lose a lot of ground. Be courageous and decide on your own.
 ----- 
 Today is going to be a great day for you, Cancer. You aren't one to embrace rules, constraints, or restrictions of any kind, preferring instead to reside in a fantasy world where no limitations apply. Have you considered that it's possible for you to join the rest of us here on Earth and still retain your liberty and ideals?
 ----- 
 It's important that you abandon the myth that you don't have any gifts or talents, Leo. Consider thinking about your talents in the same way you think about your body. When you exercise, eat right, and get plenty of rest, your body responds. Your talents are no different. They need care and nurturing, too.
 ----- 
 If you're waiting for someone to come and fill all of your needs, emotional ones in particular, you may have to wait a very long time! You're responsible for fulfilling your own needs, Virgo. If you don't, you will be eternally dependent. This would be unlike Virgo, and certainly unlike you!
 ----- 
 If you have children, their difficulties may remind you of your own, Libra. Or it may simply be that their education brings back memories of yours. Are you holding onto an issue from a period in your life that still bothers you? This would be a good moment to ask yourself the question. Ask it, then answer it and put it to rest once and for all!
 ----- 
 Don't spend beyond your means today, Scorpio! If you happen to know some enthusiastic shoppers, it could be disastrous for your finances if you get caught up in the frenzy. On the other hand, perhaps you owe yourself a reward for all your hard work. Is there a gift you could give yourself that doesn't involve money? Time, perhaps?
 ----- 
 Minor tensions could arise today, Sagittarius. People close to you, perhaps your mate or parents, seem to be trying to force you to adopt a behavior that you aren't at all willing to follow. Will you negotiate your independence gently or tear yourself free from their domination? The second possibility seems more likely.
 ----- 
 The mood may be oppressive today, Capricorn. After meeting the challenges of the past several days, you're now in need of some well
 ----- 
 This isn't a day for sensitive people like you, Aquarius. In fact, the one who shouts the loudest and bangs on the table the hardest is likely to come out the winner today. The air of violence will also have an effect on you. You will be somewhat upset, very thin
 ----- 
 Some differences of opinion concerning your love life are likely to come up today, Pisces. For example, you may find your beloved taking more liberties than you allow yourself. Take your irritation as a sign that this particular relationship could use some freshening up. The day ahead may bring you just what you seek.
 ----- 
 You may have been feeling more emotional lately, Aries. Today a fanciful energy could sweep you off your feet and into another realm entirely. Feel free to take off for at least a little while in order to gain a better perspective on the issues at hand. Strong, forceful powers are urging you to let someone else take the reins on a particular project.
 ----- 
 People and situations that you were counting on may suddenly run into opposition today, Taurus. Don't be surprised if the seat you're sitting on is suddenly pulled out from under you. Make sure you have some extra padding, since it could be a rather hard fall. More than likely, however, you will be able to take it in stride.
 ----- 
 Your ego has probably been feeling strong lately, and you may feel an extra boost of self
 ----- 
 If you knew the truth of all the things that are going on outside your world, you'd be appalled, Cancer. You shouldn't take things at face value today. It's important to simply go and see things for yourself. Don't trust another's word on what is true and what isn't. Question what you see. Make sure you don't let others pull the wool over your eyes.
 ----- 
 It isn't a good idea to try to fit people into a mold today, Leo. This will only annoy others and frustrate you. It's important that you relax and simply let people blossom into the people they want to be. If you have a preconceived notion of who they should be, you're only setting yourself up for failure and disappointment, as well as anger from the other party.
 ----- 
 Consider subscribing to an alternative newsletter of some sort, Virgo. You will find some amazing information that the general public doesn't necessarily know. Knowledge is power. For the most part, common knowledge is quite limited. Try to seek news from a wider community. Some mainstream information is pretty unreliable.
 ----- 
 Don't expect others to take much notice of your emotions today, Libra. You're more respectful of theirs than they are of yours. Find peace among all you encounter. This could be difficult since other people's wills are involved. In that case, people aren't likely to back down. Others think they're right and refuse to see things any other way.
 ----- 
 Your aggressive attitude is likely to start a fight that might be difficult to settle now, Scorpio. There are extremely stubborn forces at work, and you may find that no one is willing to budge from their position. The thing that is apt to make this even more difficult is that people may misinterpret certain pieces of the puzzle. Try to bring understanding to the situation instead of more aggression.
 ----- 
 People may be difficult to deal with today, Sagittarius. You may soon discover that they're just as stubborn as you are. Try to give others the benefit of the doubt or there will be a stalemate in just about every corner of your life. Don't consider it a loss or failure of character if you find you need to make some concessions in order to get things to work.
 ----- 
 Your ego may be under some stress today, Capricorn. The tricky part is that the threat you feel is probably a result of something that isn't even completely real. It could be that someone is acting on false information that has no bearing on the reality of the situation. You might be swept away by someone else's false impression of who you really are.
 ----- 
 You could develop a stomachache if you try to sort out all the confused issues of the day, Aquarius. There are apt to be too many matters for you to handle alone, so don't even try. It's one of those situations in which you start to untangle one knot only to create another somewhere down the line. It's best to just let the ball of string lie where it is for now.
 ----- 
 You may have your mind set on some big plans that you've been working on for some time now, Pisces. The problem is that today there is some conflict with something or someone with a large ego who suddenly wants a piece of the pie. Either that or this person wants to burst your bubble. Don't give up hope on your dreams. Realize that this opposition is just part of the adventure.
 ----- 
 You have a creative and artistic nature that you might want to put to good use today, Aries. You could have some good ideas for home improvements. Perhaps you need some bookcases to help you get organized, or maybe you want a complete redecoration. Whatever you do, Aries, it's bound to look beautiful. When it comes to artistic endeavors, you definitely have the touch.
 ----- 
 You may miss friends and family who live far away, Taurus. Why not make yourself a cup of tea and write some letters? It will help you feel connected in a different way than sending an email or making a call. Remember that you're blessed to have these people in your life even if you don't see them as often as you'd like.
 ----- 
 You may have recently inherited either some money or some free time. This is a real gift, and if invested wisely, it could lead to some important self
 ----- 
 Today is well suited for making new friends, Cancer. Your sense of adventure is undoubtedly up to it! You will be your usual confident self, but others will seem to respond to your charisma even more than usual. If youre able to attend a small party, you may meet someone who lives far away who invites you to visit at a later date. What a wonderful opportunity for travel!
 ----- 
 This is a very spiritual and creative day for you, Leo. You're especially intuitive. Any creative effort will likely resonate deeply. Even if you don't feel you have the talent for it, why not try some form of artistic expression? You could dabble with a paintbrush or makes notes in a journal. Don't let that pesky internal editor kick in. Create for the sheer joy of it.
 ----- 
 Today is ideal for romance, Virgo. It's great for forming new relationships or improving existing ones. If you don't have a special someone, make an effort to expand your social circle. Attend a lecture or take a workshop. If you have a mate, do something different together that helps you get to know one another better. A spiritual retreat might be just the boost your relationship needs.
 ----- 
 You have a good heart, Libra, and today it expands to bestow love on all mankind. You can't help but feel connected in a deep, spiritual way with all who have come before you and all who follow. Even if you don't have a lot of money, consider setting up an annual giving plan that will benefit worthwhile causes. This would be a direct expression of your feelings and could potentially help many people.
 ----- 
 You will likely find it difficult to keep your mind on serious matters with today's playful planetary energies, Scorpio. You're in the mood for romance, and you want to make sure everything is in place for a flawless evening with that special someone. You have the sexy outfit and food being delivered, and that's just for starters. No wonder you can't concentrate, with such an amazing evening to look forward to.
 ----- 
 Your innate talent and conscientious work ethic earn you admiration and respect. Whether you're aware of it or not, others look up to you as someone who has it together. Yet you still have that nagging doubt that you're an impostor. Today's astral energies ask you to look at where these doubts originate. It's time to get to the source and exorcise the monsters for good! They have nothing to do with your success.
 ----- 
 It looks as though you're about to hop on the bandwagon, Capricorn. Friends will try to get you to support one of their causes. Think carefully. They aren't going to settle for a check. They want your hands
 ----- 
 Love and passion are at the forefront of your thoughts today, Aquarius. Work seems tedious compared to the rich fantasy inside your head! If possible, make a point of getting together tonight with your mate. He or she is likely feeling as amorous as you. You two have much to celebrate. The celestial atmosphere is conducive to the deepening of your relationship.
 ----- 
 If you became an animal today, you'd be a puppy, Pisces, all frisky and affectionate. By all means, put your passion to good use! Surprise a special someone with a home
 ----- 
 Today, Aries, you can expect to be somewhat more enterprising in your relationships. You may find new friends or enjoy spending quality time with some old ones, if possible. Perhaps you will look forward to an intensification of your love life. With today's planetary configuration, you will surely find excellent resources for improving your emotional well
 ----- 
 Recent aspects have allowed you to affirm yourself at work and, in a more general way, cement some aspects of your personality. Now you will be consolidating things. It's as if you've conceived of a product, created it, and are now finally ready to put it on the market. If this is in fact the case, Taurus, the current period corresponds to incoming money 
 ----- 
 Today's planetary aspects herald the beginning of an especially agreeable period. You will carry confidence, clarity, and positive influence wherever you go, Gemini. You've used up a lot of your reserves recently and made it to this stage just in the nick of time. Enjoy your new strength.
 ----- 
 Today's planetary configurations indicate that this would be a good moment to get rid of everything that's still holding you back from an impending rebirth, Cancer. One stumbling block for you may be the impulse that you seem to have to blend in with others. You're an individual, Cancer. This isn't something to overcome. It should be celebrated!
 ----- 
 Today's planetary configurations indicate that you can expect a very profitable period coming up, Leo. You've worked hard lately, and it's only natural that you should finally arrive at this stage. You're going to be able to measure the distance you've come, and above all, evaluate your power. Whatever you do, think big!
 ----- 
 Today's aspects ask you to make more of an effort, Virgo. You will have to come back down to Earth and join the rest of us mere mortals. You may be cultivating your independence a bit too much. It pulls you away from people. You should try to mingle and get involved in a cause that's bigger than you. Working with others is a necessary part of any job.
 ----- 
 You can interpret today's aspects in several ways, Libra. The planetary configurations correspond to a search for space, whether physical or intellectual. You may be asking yourself philosophical questions, or perhaps you're thinking of taking a long trip in the future. What will you decide to do? Will you read Kant or plan your dream trip?
 ----- 
 In navigating the seas of your emotional life, Scorpio, you may feel as though you've made a great effort over the past month. You've been available and conciliatory and have done your best to maintain harmony. With today's celestial energy, you want to be more spontaneous. The enterprising and reckless you has returned!
 ----- 
 With today's celestial configuration, your emotional universe will once again glow with positive energy. You will be meeting more people, and your encounters are likely to be more profound. The coming weeks are quite promising for you, Sagittarius. The music will be in the key to pleasure and sensuality. Allow the music to fill your senses!
 ----- 
 For you, Capricorn, the changing planetary configuration portends a period of timidity. You will probably go out less, introduce yourself to fewer new people, and be less prone to show off. But any relationships you form will be much more intense than usual. The weeks ahead are quite promising, although you may have to readjust some of your attitudes.
 ----- 
 You may have spent the past few weeks exploring new horizons, talking to new people, going out more frequently in the evening, when possible, or even making short trips away from home. But this is a moment to settle down. Today's celestial configuration is giving you the incentive you need to stabilize yourself. Expect some pleasurable moments in the comfort of your home, Aquarius.
 ----- 
 You're likely to enjoy today's change of tone, Pisces. Don't you feel a need to take friendships beyond the superficial level? Perhaps you should reestablish contact with some former friends, too, although you may find that you have some bonds to repair. In any case, you can expect another month devoted to sweeping the cobwebs out of your emotional universe in order to let in sunlight and promise.
 ----- 
 You're entering a period of doubt, especially about your love life. You like your relationships and feelings to be clear. You may think a lot about your relationships over the next few days. Are you sure you've chosen the right person? Are his or her feelings sincere? Could you live without this person? The next two months will bring you the answers. Don't forget, no one is perfect.
 ----- 
 For a month you may have had problems communicating with the people close to you, Taurus. This is nothing to worry about, yet it might make you feel off balance. This is a great day to settle conflicts from the last month or make your feelings clear to other people. Don't be afraid to play "truth or dare." Honesty is the best policy. Dare them to be honest with you.
 ----- 
 Gemini, you tend to live your life vicariously through your partner. Today you may come to the realization that this isn't healthy for you. You may realize that you give more of yourself than you get back, draining you of energy. In fact, you're almost completely out. Be selfish today. You need to do something for you for once, and it's about time!
 ----- 
 Cancer, you see new horizons. It's possible that the changes you've been going through lately aren't completely finished. You may even have a hard time keeping yourself from running away from it all. Your rebirth will only be complete after you clearly define your desires. Use today to think about what you want. Things aren't completely clear.
 ----- 
 Leo, you hide your emotional needs from others. You need to be able to trust someone in order to share your feeling. They have to guess at your deepest secrets. Today you could save a lot of time in your love life if you just tell your partner what you want out of your relationship or even what you'd like to change about it. Talk about it. Your partner is listening.
 ----- 
 Today you may want to change some of the moral and social values that get in the way of relationships. After surmounting these kinds of obstacles yourself, and watching others struggle with them, you've decided that it's time to do away with them once and for all. Just be careful to respect the private lives of the people close to you. Not everyone is as open
 ----- 
 Libra, the people around you sometimes have a hard time understanding where you're going. You're living in an imaginary world that has little to do with reality. If you decide to stay home and lie around the house, you will have no problems. If you have to go to work, try to be as clear as possible with others. If you don't, your proposals could fall on deaf ears.
 ----- 
 You may have doubts over the next few days, Scorpio. Don't make any important decisions about your future during this relatively unproductive period. If someone in your professional or personal life asks you to make more of a commitment, you may be tempted to put on the brakes without really knowing why. Wait a while before answering this kind of question.
 ----- 
 What are you afraid of, Sagittarius? Is it contact with other people? It's as if an invisible rope were holding you back from getting close to people, or worse, pulling you back. What's this about? You're going through a period that's closely linked to your past. A failed relationship still haunts you and casts its shadow on the current one. Get rid of the skeletons in your closet!
 ----- 
 It's very possible that you will want to take a step back today in order to take a closer look at your relationships. Your address book is full of names. Your phone rings off the hook. You receive tons of texts and emails every day. Yet isn't it funny that you feel alone? It's time to get rid of the superficial relationships and concentrate on those that really mean something to you.
 ----- 
 If you feel you've been looking to the past lately, Aquarius, it's in order to liberate yourself from it. You may feel like revisiting your childhood or rekindling certain relationships with old friends. But the planets are making you a bit too romantic, and the reality of things will disappoint you. Looking backward isn't the best way to move toward the future. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be!
 ----- 
 Sometimes your relationships are like magnets, Pisces. When you want to get close, the other person tries to get away from you. When you take a step back, he or she runs back into your life. Human nature is complex. Right now, you're probably taking a step back, although you haven't given up completely. This rest will give you time to think about which side of you is the most magnetic.
 ----- 
 Electrical or plumbing problems with your house might come up. Call a professional, Aries. Don't try to fix it yourself, because you could make it worse. Friends might want to visit but tell them to wait until another day. Discussions could quickly deteriorate into arguments today. This is a great day to work quietly alone on whatever interests you the most.
 ----- 
 Stay close to home today, Taurus. Spending too much time in the car could lead to stress or, in extreme cases, minor accidents. On the job, this could turn out to be one of those days. Avoid office politics and stay out of arguments. Try to sequester yourself and do your work alone. Days like this are best used to take care of your affairs quickly and efficiently.
 ----- 
 Money matters might take a turn for the worse today. Don't fly off the handle because of this, Gemini. Use every bit of financial savvy you have to put things straight. Try to remain calm and collected when dealing with stubborn people. Don't be drawn into arguments. You will be able to pull everything together again, but only by your ingenuity. Don't depend on others.
 ----- 
 Cancer, check your house to make certain everything is in working order. There are indications that small hazards could exist that need correcting. Tension might run high among family members, and quarrels could result. Don't waste time trying to mediate. They will have to work it out for themselves. This is a great day for study and solitude since your mind is especially sharp.
 ----- 
 Short visits in your neighborhood could catapult you into some negative situations, Leo. It's best to stay close to home if you can. An angry letter or call could put you in a shaky mood. This isn't a day to socialize. Days like this are best spent keeping to yourself and throwing your energy into taking care of whatever you're working on.
 ----- 
 Today you might be a bit worried about your financial affairs, Virgo. A past mistake could have led to some rather upsetting consequences. Now you need to harness every bit of skill you have in order to set things straight. Your knowledge of modern technology could help. A friend might try to pick a quarrel with you, but it's best to stay cool, neutral, and out of the discussion.
 ----- 
 Your physical energy is very high today, Libra. You're likely to want to get out and exercise, perhaps jog through the park or attend a virtual aerobics class. Be careful! You might not be as fit as you think and trying too hard could cause minor injuries. Someone you know professionally might not be in a great mood. You could get swept up in their anger. Try to stay out of it.
 ----- 
 Uncertainty about spiritual matters and doubt about your insights might have you down in the dumps today. Don't try to force any solutions 
 ----- 
 If a friend or acquaintance gives you advice about money or investments today, don't take it. To follow this unknowledgeable person's lead might prove to be disastrous. Participation in group activities also isn't advisable. They could get out of hand, and you could find end up in the middle of an angry crowd. This is a great day to stay home, Sagittarius. Work on your own project.
 ----- 
 Gossip and bad feelings among co
 ----- 
 Too much running around might have you feeling exhausted and under the weather today, Aquarius. You may have been exercising a little too much. Therefore, this is a good day to avoid exercise and get some rest. Don't push yourself too hard! This isn't a good day to plan or start a vacation. Wait a few days, as trips planned at this time could be fraught with glitches.
 ----- 
 You could feel extremely passionate today, Pisces. You might want to connect with a love partner but be prevented by circumstances. You might be attracted to racier novels or movies. Repressed anger could bubble up from your subconscious and seek an outlet. This is a great day to channel that anger into some artistic activity. Don't be surprised if you use a lot of red!
 ----- 
 Powerful issues arise in your life that make it difficult to find peace, Aries. Perhaps your first tendency is to confide in your partner. More than likely, this person is contributing to the difficulties you're now having. Your best bet is to spend some time alone. If you're already alone, so much the better. Cherish this time instead of letting it make you mad.
 ----- 
 You may be trying to get to the end of the road too quickly without really enjoying all the steps along the way, Taurus. This is especially true when it comes to any sort of artistic project or romantic partnership that you might be involved in at this time. If you aren't savoring every part of your journey, then perhaps this isn't the path you should be on.
 ----- 
 When your heart is gently touched, it feels loving, generous, and supportive of everyone, Gemini. If your heart is lonely, it feels deserted by everyone. It would be impossible to try to make sense of why things need to be so extreme for you, but the fact of the matter is that you don't need to figure it out rationally. You only need to accept that this is how you feel.
 ----- 
 You may be like a giant trying to befriend a small bug, Cancer. You have absolutely nothing in common and don't even speak the same language. With one accidental move, you could easily squash that little bug. This isn't to say that you can't learn to become best friends. Just know that this kind of relationship is going to take some work.
 ----- 
 There is irony in today's situation, Leo. The only real remedy for situations like this is to accept them and joke about it. If you try to take yourself too seriously, especially when it comes to art or romance, you will inevitably fail. Your heart is sensual and your emotions profound. Bring yourself into balance by laughing instead of crying about the events of the day.
 ----- 
 The hungrier you get, the more determined you will become, Virgo. Be careful that your determination doesn't turn into desperation and neediness. It's unattractive and will get you nowhere. Keep on the upward spiral, and let determination turn into inspiration and cooperation. You will find this especially true when it comes to matters of the heart. You have a great deal of power. Put it to good use.
 ----- 
 If you're in the market for romance, Libra, whether with a new partner or rekindling the fire with a current partner, be careful. Small issues could rage out control today. Extreme conditions are likely to occur, thanks to your sensitive emotions combined with a surge of energy from the outside. Try not to get too upset when tension rises because of something unimportant.
 ----- 
 Things may get a bit difficult in your romantic life because of someone in the partnership who isn't necessarily taking a very realistic approach to the situation, Scorpio. There's a bit of a power play going on as someone tries to throw their weight around without considering the other person's feelings. Tension is brewing, and you'd be wise to deal with it now.
 ----- 
 Your creative juices are flowing freely, Sagittarius, but there appears to be a roadblock. Something or someone apparently doesn't want you to continue down the path you're on. Perhaps he or she is scared that you're going to discover a whole new passion in life that they don't necessarily agree with. Don't forget who is running your show 
 ----- 
 At the end of the day, you're the one who has to look in the mirror and know who you are, Capricorn. Think about this the next time you're tempted to make a rude comment or spread a displeasing fact about someone else. One side of you may be able to rationalize behavior that the other side simply despises. Today look at both of sides of yourself, not just the one that pleases you.
 ----- 
 When it comes to romance, your body is apt to turn to jelly today. You may be so emotional that you can't function, Aquarius. That's love. And even though it can be heavenly, it can also be debilitating. You could deliberate for hours about an issue because you don't want to make a move without your partner's input. If you don't have a romantic partner now, find one soon, but not today.
 ----- 
 Will you go out with me? Be careful if a person says yes when you ask that question today, Pisces. You could take the nature of this situation to the extreme. Saying yes doesn't mean you're suddenly in charge of his or her life. Nor are you responsible for anything that person does or how they feel. If you're still asking the question without getting any positive responses, don't worry. Keep trying.
 ----- 
 Your mind could be going in many directions, Aries. Direct your energy toward small projects that require intellect. Your energy is likely to come in waves, so use it wisely when you have it, and feel free to take a break when you don't. Tell your boss that you will be much more productive if you have a 20
 ----- 
 People will listen to you much more than usual, Taurus. Sometimes when you say something, people hear you but minutes later forget what you said. Today is different. Your words will penetrate more deeply and end up being disseminated much more widely than ever before. Don't be stingy with what you have to say. Give people your full opinion on the situation. Your impact will be significant.
 ----- 
 You're apt to disagree sharply with information you receive, Gemini. Perhaps your attitude is a bit selfish, so you aren't able to appreciate ideas that are more humanitarian in nature. Expand your way of thinking to include the people around you. You will find that the more you offer yourself to others, the more respected and happier you will be overall.
 ----- 
 Climactic events are apt to occur in your life, Cancer. It's time to condense and solidify your grand schemes and bright ideas in such a way that makes them more practical. Things may be spinning so quickly that you aren't quite sure where to jump on. Worry about that later. For now, what you need to do is express your ideas forcefully and succinctly. Doors will open as a result.
 ----- 
 It's time to take your communication to the next level, Leo. Expand outward and upward. For the last three weeks you've gone through a serious mental process that has helped you define what you stand for and believe in. Now you're in a phase that urges you to put these ideas into motion. The expansive quality of the day is profound, so take advantage of it and get moving.
 ----- 
 A new cycle is beginning for you in which you may find yourself throwing away old beliefs and mental processes, Virgo. Out with the old and in with the new. This time of housecleaning is extremely important, for you will find that the same tired old speech that you've been working on is suddenly defunct. Pull your resources together and construct a new platform that makes you proud.
 ----- 
 You may feel like you're on a cliff with your legs dangling over the edge, Libra. You're searching for handholds while your feet struggle to support you on a tiny ledge. You may be swearing that when you get out of this predicament, you will never come this way again. Take heart. This is all part of the cycle. These necessary challenges only make you stronger and more appreciative of the easy stretches.
 ----- 
 Someone has suddenly put the fan on high, Scorpio, and papers are blowing everywhere. Neat piles whisked into large swirls of chaos. Everyone is shouting opinions about what should be done about it. Meanwhile, there are people making demands on you that you just can't handle. Slow down and communicate your situation to others. They will understand and support your predicament. The wind will die down soon.
 ----- 
 Try not to get tangled in other people's words, Sagittarius. It could be that you're accidentally misconstruing their statements because you aren't listening closely. Rather, your mind is focused on your own thoughts, even though you snap to attention when something hits you wrong. Show respect by turning down the volume in your head when someone else has the floor, even if you don't agree with what they're saying.
 ----- 
 There's a terrific expansive feeling to the day, Capricorn, which you will appreciate more than anyone. For other people, this energy might expand into a headache. For you, it's apt to expand your feeling of success. It also might expand your stomach, so be careful that you don't overindulge. Other than that, don't hold back on your activities. Whatever you do will be very productive.
 ----- 
 There might be some unexpected communication coming from a long
 ----- 
 This is one of those days when you just can't wait for someone to stop talking so you can say something, Pisces. It's likely you won't even wait. Don't be surprised if friction results from such strongly held opposing views. People could blow things out of proportion, since everyone is convinced that they are right. The interesting thing about this situation is that it could result in a productive time.
 ----- 
 Your words may fall sharply on someone's ears today, so be aware of the impact you can have, Aries. However, this doesn't mean that you need to dilute your message with lies in order to avoid the true topic of conversation. Just be conscious of the fact that a strong emotional response is apt to result when you open up to the truth and tell it like it is.
 ----- 
 Be careful of being hypocritical, Taurus. You may not want to disappoint people you meet, so you end up stretching the truth to suit what they want to hear. You may catch yourself a minute later telling someone else the opposite in order to protect his or her estimation of you. Figure out who you are and stick to it. If other people don't like you, that's their problem not yours.
 ----- 
 You may find that someone approaches you with harsh words that are apt to have a significant impact on your state of mind. You could even find that you're paralyzed in the sense that you begin to question your current actions or ones you plan to take in the future. Spend some time alone in order to sort things out before you go ahead and make any drastic life
 ----- 
 You may have to make an important decision today, Cancer. It has come to the point where someone draws a line in the sand and challenges you to cross it. Do you stay where you are and continue on without that person, or do you join them and support their goals and actions? The conflict today is between your head and your gut. Don't limit your choices to two. There are always compromises.
 ----- 
 As you take another step upward today, Leo, you may realize that there's a large part of the mountain you hadn't accounted for before. Perhaps this steep portion of the climb wasn't visible from below when you started the trip. Don't panic. By overreacting to the unknown, you may lose your balance and go sliding down the face of the mountain. Collect yourself, rest, and plan your strategy one step at a time.
 ----- 
 Try not to overanalyze your actions, Virgo. If you continue to pick apart every aspect, you will end up getting nowhere. This principle applies to your emotions, too. Be sure that you aren't trying to make rational sense out of every feeling that comes your way. Feelings are there for you to experience. Allow them to flow through your heart and not necessarily your head.
 ----- 
 Your actions may go against your rational thinking, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, Libra. Thoughts and feelings are apt to aggressively clash today, but that doesn't mean you have to be a victim of the resulting demolition. Note the big pieces that survive after the initial impact. Recognize these as your strengths and work to build them back up while leaving the smaller pieces behind.
 ----- 
 You may have the perfect plan all laid out, Scorpio. You've communicated to the right people, you've traveled to the appropriate spots to gather data, and you have all your resources in line. For some reason, however, every time you start to implement this plan, you run into emotional difficulties that seem too challenging to surmount. Don't let this block you from your dreams.
 ----- 
 What you think may happen today is apt to be the opposite of what actually happens, Sagittarius. It could be that you have a strong mental picture of how things should proceed but end up taking a completely different action. Try to engage every part of your body, mind, and spirit so that all are on the same page regardless of what activity you actually do.
 ----- 
 Emotions may cloud your thoughts as things start to heat up in a heavy way, Capricorn. In an effort to keep things light and energetic, you may be missing the core of the situation. Don't glance too quickly over all the issues. The answer to the riddle is right there in front of you. Stop for a minute to catch your breath and you will find the solutions that you seek.
 ----- 
 Magical events may occur today in the most unlikely places, Aquarius. Perhaps you're expecting to see someone in a certain environment. Even if you don't see him or her there, you will end up meeting at a special event in an entirely different place. Let your goal be your main focus. Let the details of the journey fall into place however they will.
 ----- 
 If you find that you aren't necessarily thinking like the rest of the group, don't panic, Pisces. In fact, this is probably a good thing. By going along with the crowd, you may be expected to act a certain way in some situations. Pretty soon you're living like a marionette strung up to a couple of sticks and manipulated by an unknown hand. Think for yourself.
 ----- 
 Today you could complete a creative project that you've been working on for a while, Aries. You will be more than happy with the results and inspired to move on to bigger and better things. You will feel strong enough to take on just about any type of project. It's possible that you might get started on the next one right away. Don't wear yourself out!
 ----- 
 Things seem to be returning to normal after the hectic pace of late, Taurus. Life has slowed down, and the energy is lower but more peaceful. There's also no rush to get anything done. The deadlines can be postponed to another day. You might take whatever spare time you have to just lie back and enjoy the quiet. Don't feel guilty. You can work hard again tomorrow!
 ----- 
 Have you been waiting for a letter or call from a business or romantic partner for a long time, Gemini? If so, you will probably receive it today. Don't be surprised if it's long! News and useful information could be exchanged. You will feel energized and determined once the communication is completed. The partnership's future goals will be more strictly defined as a result.
 ----- 
 Your time finally seems to be your own, Cancer. There are probably no rush jobs to finish, no urgent phone calls to make, and no one looking over your shoulder. This causes a significant release of stress, and you're better able than usual to focus on what you have in front of you. In the evening, relax at home, order delivery, and watch a movie.
 ----- 
 A love relationship seems more stable than usual today, Leo. The security wraps itself around you like a blanket as you consider the events leading up to this new sense of commitment. You and your partner may spend the evening doing nothing more than being together, which feels great! Mark this day in your memory so you can recall it whenever your insecurities get the better of you.
 ----- 
 Today you may not feel much like working, and you might even decide to play hooky from your responsibilities, Virgo. If you have nothing urgent to do, consider indulging this whim. Relax with a good book and a cup of tea. Watch a favorite movie. Take a long walk in a beautiful park. In the evening, cuddle with a love partner. Savor the day's gentle energy.
 ----- 
 A community issue may come up today concerning you and your neighbors, Libra. Perhaps a virtual meeting will be held. Something requires change in your neighborhood, and most of you are probably firmly united behind it. This bodes well for your future, so you will probably feel good about the entire situation after the gathering breaks up. Onward and upward!
 ----- 
 A new opportunity could come your way today, Scorpio. There's no promise or guarantee, but there is an indication that if you devote yourself thoroughly, your chances of progress are pretty good over the next month for any activity that you begin today. Keep up the good work and keep smiling! The latter action is as important as the former.
 ----- 
 Have you wanted to take a certain online course or workshop, Sagittarius? If so, this is a good day to consider all the details, make some phone calls, or enroll. As far as your educational goals go, you're very focused. You're apt to stick with any program you decide to tackle. You're also apt to learn more quickly and retain more. Think about it, read the pertinent literature, then make some calls!
 ----- 
 Decisions regarding investments, savings, or other financial matters might need attention today, Capricorn. Don't panic. You're in the right frame of mind for this. Your business sense is at an all
 ----- 
 Have you and a friend been discussing the possibility of going into business together? If so, Aquarius, the two of you might want to have some serious discussions now about the nature of the business, how it should be structured, and what the financial arrangements may be. You're both sharp enough to see both the promise and the downside of your enterprise. Get some paper and pens and go to it!
 ----- 
 Has a certain project been a drag for you lately, Pisces? Don't be surprised if today you get your second wind. You're looking at your tasks in a practical manner, your interest in them is up, and you're able to accomplish them quickly and efficiently with minimal stress. Relationships should also be going well. Make the most of this while you can!
 ----- 
 A phone conversation with someone who lives far away might have you feeling a bit sad, reflecting on how much you miss that person. This can lead to pondering about your life. You might question the direction you seem to be moving in and consider other possible options. You're likely to be cautious when it comes to making final decisions, Aries. You will consider every detail.
 ----- 
 Today you might be in a reflective and meditative mood. You may think about mundane matters, such as how to increase your income, or more complex issues, such as the purpose of life. You aren't likely to want to do much socializing today, Taurus. It's probably the perfect day to stay in, relax, and enjoy your own company. Reading could prove especially informative now.
 ----- 
 Obligations to friends and groups could interfere with time that you want to spend with your partner. A number of people in your home might demand more of your time, energy, and attention, and you might find this disconcerting. You're no one's servant, Gemini. You're entitled to enjoy yourself. Save some time for your mate at the end of the day.
 ----- 
 You might wake up this morning and decide your home is a total wreck. The desire to spend the day cleaning and sprucing up your house might prove almost obsessive. Do what you have to do, but don't get so caught up that you forget about the big picture. Whatever you do today, Cancer, view it in its proper perspective. The world won't end if your house isn't flawlessly clean.
 ----- 
 Extra time and attention that you have been devoting to your career should pay off about now. You've worked hard to be where you are, and you aren't through climbing the ladder of success just yet. You aren't likely to rest on your laurels. Today you might spend a lot of time planning your next goal. A little ingenuity will definitely pay off here, Leo. Use whatever advantages you have.
 ----- 
 An older male visitor could contact you, possibly offering to help you with some work that needs to be done. Family members may have abandoned you for the day to go out and do their own thing. You will welcome the offer. Practical matters, such as the household budget, might need attention, so set aside some time to work out the details.
 ----- 
 Today you might perform some service to people who live in your neighborhood. Perhaps you will chauffeur people around to do their shopping. Perhaps you will help people with household tasks. Pets may also need some attention. Whatever it is, you will enjoy helping in whatever way is possible, and be appreciated as well. Expect to have a very busy day. You will certainly sleep soundly tonight.
 ----- 
 Meticulous and sincere effort on your part may have led to a recent increase in income. Today you might be thinking of reworking your budget. While others might throw caution to the wind at a time like this, today you might go too far in the opposite direction. Be careful and realistic, Scorpio, but don't be overly frugal. You've worked hard to get where you are, and you deserve a reward.
 ----- 
 A sense of duty toward family members, children, and your sweetheart may cause you to take on responsibilities today that you wouldn't normally assume. Sincere efforts on behalf of those you care about are likely to bring the results you want. It won't just make you happy but will also please those you are helping. This not only makes you feel appreciated, it will also boost your physical strength.
 ----- 
 Emotions stemming from past experiences might cause you to assume undue responsibilities, particularly concerning family members. This is fine as long as you realize what you're doing is as much for you as for the other person. Whatever tasks you assume may allow you to release old traumas and give form to your plans and ambitions. And don't be surprised if those you help today go to bat for you later.
 ----- 
 Relatives or neighbors may come to you today asking for favors. Some may know exactly what buttons to push in order to get you to do what they want. Don't be sucked into guilt or other negative emotions. Help others if you wish, Aquarius, but recognize that you're doing it because you want to and not because you feel you have to. You might even learn something about yourself in the process.
 ----- 
 A temporary lack of belief in your abilities might have you hesitating to start a project or take on a task that you'd normally snap up. This could involve something you've wanted to try or helping someone else. Your faith in yourself should never flag, but if it does, it's important to remember that hard work can be as important as talent 
 ----- 
 Information that comes your way today could launch you into a search for truth, Aries. Perhaps this is a new business
 ----- 
 Although you're usually very responsible and you try to keep the proper balance between your home and professional lives, today your mind and heart are more focused on your home, Taurus. A warm sense of unity with family and close friends could make for a very pleasant day and an even more pleasant evening. Even finishing up paperwork will seem easier than usual. Relax and enjoy a great evening.
 ----- 
 Having a sense of community unites the people around you in aiming for a common goal, and this could be a new interest for you, Gemini. Warm and loving emails and calls could come from family, close friends, or your life partner. An impromptu short trip to a favorite place could result in a pleasant surprise. This promises to be a busy day and a great one.
 ----- 
 You may have been expecting some money over the past several days, and today it could finally arrive. Delays in reaching your goals are finished for the moment. If you have a project you've been trying to complete, Cancer, this is the day to do it, especially if it involves paperwork. This isn't the day to compete with anyone, however. Your sense of cooperation is too strong.
 ----- 
 You're feeling especially sharp, Leo. Your thoughts are more focused than usual and your mind especially penetrating. A promised get
 ----- 
 Practical thoughts may be the result of unconscious impulses brought to the surface by events at home. Old traumas and phobias could be released, although you should take care to not dwell on them too much or you'll reinforce them instead of getting rid of them. Your imagination is flying high. You might focus it on decorating your house. You could find antiques especially appealing.
 ----- 
 Gatherings in your neighborhood could bring new and interesting information your way, Libra. A message from an acquaintance could send you down a new path toward a new goal. Relations with everyone around you 
 ----- 
 Success in a project you've been working on could mean you want to go out and celebrate. You might feel guilty about doing it, but go ahead, Scorpio. Order a glass of wine and dessert! Tonight is the night to forget work and go for sheer, unadulterated pleasure. You have the break coming. Your efforts are finally being recognized, and you're on your way. Enjoy your good fortune!
 ----- 
 A subject that you've been studying for a long time might suddenly start making sense to you, Sagittarius. Or you could finally reach a point where you can make it work for you in a practical way. Your thinking now is especially clear, focused, down to Earth, and efficient, so whatever you try or start today is likely to lead to success. Don't let occasional self
 ----- 
 Past impressions that you may not even know you have could enhance your ability to deal with practical matters today, Capricorn. You might need to handle some paperwork regarding a settlement of some kind. The thoughts and feelings of those closest to you are more apparent than usual. You may tailor your behavior toward them accordingly. Spend a quiet evening with your loved ones. You won't even need to talk.
 ----- 
 Small social events and group activities are on the agenda today if at all possible, Aquarius. You may be introduced to someone who could prove helpful to your career. A letter containing good news could come from a friend or partner. Any new moneymaking enterprise begun now is likely to succeed as long as you stay with it and continue to face it in a businesslike manner.
 ----- 
 Glowing health and an enthusiastic attitude make almost anything a pleasure today, Pisces. Relations with friends and family are warm, congenial, and cooperative. Your day should go as smoothly as you could expect. There is something you want to do in the afternoon that you're looking forward to. In the evening, consider attending an online class, lecture, or workshop. Your mind is especially sharp right now.
 ----- 
 Problems with machines could have your nerves on edge. This may be one day when everything seems to break. Some problems you might be able to fix yourself, Aries, but at least one may involve something that has to be replaced. This might be the one you need the most right now. Think of it as a sign from the universe that you should do something else. That's the only way to stay sane.
 ----- 
 Today you might attend a small party or group event with some friends, if possible, and become separated from them. Don't panic, Taurus. You will probably run into them later. You might meet some new friends and hear some news that could interest you. This is a day when cell phones and other handheld devices are likely to come in handy. You will want to record or pass on a lot of information.
 ----- 
 Surprise visitors could result in a small impromptu party of some sort, if possible. This could be fun for you, Gemini, but it could also be a bit irritating. It might interfere with something you had planned. There's nothing you can do without sounding like Scrooge. Go with the flow, enjoy yourself, and then try to salvage your own plans as best as you can.
 ----- 
 This isn't the day to plan a trip by air, Cancer. Everything that can go wrong with such a trip will 
 ----- 
 One of your ambitions in life is to be financially independent, and lately you might have made great strides toward attaining that goal. Today, through no fault of your own, you may receive information that indicates there may have been a setback. However, all is not as it seems. Don't go into a panic until you know all the facts, Leo. You're probably still right on track.
 ----- 
 A surprising revelation from a friend or acquaintance might wake you up to the fact that you don't really know this person as well as you thought you did. Information could set you off on a search for knowledge that keeps you occupied for hours. A child or young person could come to you and ask for help. This promises to be a busy but interesting day, Virgo. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Your mind is likely to be going a thousand miles an hour today, Libra. Thoughts and ideas are pouring into your head like rain from the sky. Some of them might be confusing and others contradictory. You might be tempted to puzzle over them until you give yourself a headache. Write them down and look at them in a day or two. Your ideas are more likely to make sense to you then.
 ----- 
 An old friend you haven't seen for a long time may suddenly resurface, perhaps contacting you through social media. This could take you by surprise, Scorpio, but you won't be any less happy to talk to him or her again. Surprising news of another kind may come to you through email or phone, and this might set you off in a totally different direction from the one you started in this morning.
 ----- 
 A sudden, unexpected problem at home could be rather upsetting. This probably relates to plumbing, electricity, or some other kind of home equipment. You will have to handle it, Sagittarius, which means you will be housebound for most of the day waiting for a repairman when you'd rather be out. A friend might hear of your predicament and come over to keep you company.
 ----- 
 Upsetting news that you receive from far away, perhaps by phone or email, could send you into an emotional tailspin. There's an aura of uncertainty about what you hear 
 ----- 
 Computer glitches or bank errors might send erroneous information to you about your finances. Perhaps the bank says you have less money than you do, or a bill is higher than you thought it should be. If you can, make sure it gets settled today. You won't want to spend your day under this cloud. You will probably want to indulge in total frivolity. Go ahead, Aquarius, you deserve it!
 ----- 
 You and someone close could disagree on an issue that both of you feel strongly about. Stubborn pride on both your parts could keep you from working things out. Let it go, Pisces. It isn't worth ruining your relationship. Someone you know might be headed for divorce or moving away, and the news could be a shock to you. This should be a day of surprises 
 ----- 
 Today you might feel a bit bloated and slow, Aries, which could interfere with your daily routine. You could also feel unmotivated about work. You might not feel like exercising, but it's important that you do it anyway. Moving the body can clear your head and put you in the proper frame of mind to get on with your day. It can also help purge your tissues of all the excess toxins.
 ----- 
 Today your job or another activity could require your artistic skills for a particular project, Taurus. You may not be used to this, so it could throw you into a bit of a panic. There should be others around who can collaborate with you, so you will be all right. A tendency to be overly emotional could interfere with just about anything you try. Stay centered.
 ----- 
 A subject of interest that you've been pursuing could bring up some deeply buried emotions today, Gemini. You might want to retreat into your mind and try to make sense of it, although analyzing it intellectually may not be the answer. Avoid emotional confrontations. Things might be said that shouldn't be said, and they won't be easily forgotten. In the evening, watch a movie full of special effects.
 ----- 
 This could be a confusing day for you, Cancer. Financial issues might be complicated by computer glitches or failures in communication. Keep pushing, however, and whatever you're trying to straighten out will be resolved. An opportunity to participate in a project you've never tried before could have you doubting your abilities. Believe in yourself and then move ahead. There's a first time for everything!
 ----- 
 Financial issues might have you and your partner a bit more on edge than you need to be, Leo. Perhaps money is tighter than usual right now, and you have to put off purchases you want to make. Try to work it out. This is a great day to reach a compromise in just about any touchy situation, because you should be in just the right space to see both sides of any issue.
 ----- 
 Today your intellect is flying high, Virgo. A number of new ideas, perhaps about political or social issues, might excite your curiosity and cause you to want to spend hours in the library or on the Internet. Mundane tasks still need handling, however. This might be frustrating because it takes you away from your quest. If you get the basics done quickly, you can return without causing any undue guilt.
 ----- 
 Your imagination is working overtime today, Libra, and you might spend hours at a computer writing or in front of an easel or piano creating your own brand of painting or music. This drive to create comes from the heart and shouldn't be ignored no matter what other issues come up. Take care of whatever needs to be handled and then follow your inspiration. You may be surprised at what you produce!
 ----- 
 A conflict between your responsibilities to family and obligations to friends could rear its ugly head today, Scorpio. You might want to attend an event but need to deal with emotional issues in the home immediately. It could be difficult to keep a cool head under these circumstances. If you can, you should find a way to satisfy your family and go out. Step back and be objective!
 ----- 
 Dissatisfaction with certain job conditions might come to a head today, Sagittarius. A discussion with colleagues might be necessary to defuse a potentially explosive situation. Clear, honest communication is necessary in order to avoid misunderstandings. Try to remain objective. Don't let your emotions take control. Things will work out to everyone's satisfaction. The situation is temporary and unlikely to have lasting negative effects.
 ----- 
 If you've been planning a long trip by air, Capricorn, today you might doubt whether you should continue with your plans. Money or safety might be the issues. Be aware that your fears may run away with you. The situation may be more secure than it appears. You might want to attend an online class or lecture, perhaps on computer science or some other technology. As with the vacation plans, try to view this objectively.
 ----- 
 Today you might feel too overwrought to concentrate on whatever goals you're trying to reach, particularly if they're financial. Past issues might crop up at inopportune times but will still need to be released. If you aren't careful, this could get in the way of just about anything you need to do. Keeping cool is the most important thing to remember.
 ----- 
 You tend to be pretty self
 ----- 
 Is your workplace upgrading its equipment? Are you in the process of increasing your technology skills? Today's planets show that success and advancement through technology are definitely in the offing for you, Aries. If you've been thinking about purchasing a computer, do it today if you can. Whatever your goals, you can harness current innovations to help them along. Give it some thought!
 ----- 
 Some close friends could turn you on to a new interest or perhaps a group you might want to join. Intellectual stimulation through those closest to you could open the way to new plans and innovations. You might want to try combining artistic interests with technology, Taurus, perhaps expanding your knowledge of photography, computer graphics, or filmmaking. Success and good fortune through such activities are strongly indicated.
 ----- 
 Sudden, unexpected news could arrive today, perhaps by mail or phone. You could host a virtual group meeting of some kind. A lot of exciting information and stimulating conversation could take place, Gemini, bringing fresh ideas that spark new interests. Expect a very busy but productive day, looking ahead toward the future rather than back toward the past.
 ----- 
 Short journeys in your neighborhood, perhaps connected with a group you're associated with, could take up a lot of your time today, Cancer. Fascinating and stimulating emails or calls could arrive. Books and magazine articles could provide information that sends you in a new direction in some way. Write down your ideas! You will want to remember them all.
 ----- 
 Unexpected money developments could brighten your day today, Leo. Perhaps you will get a raise or an increase in some other form of income. Technology could be involved in some way, or a long
 ----- 
 A surprising revelation, either from within or from sources like books, the Internet, or communications from others could set you in an entirely new direction. You will have an increased sense of freedom, as well as a clearer and more progressive outlook. You might consider some pretty heavy changes in your life, Virgo, but don't make any final decisions or arrangements today. Wait before putting your ideas into action.
 ----- 
 Discoveries made through occult sciences such as astrology or numerology could see you embrace some rather revolutionary ideas about yourself, the world, and life. You could become involved with a group associated with metaphysical studies or take an online class or workshop of some kind. This could mean a new direction for you in some way, Libra. It might greatly enhance your life and thinking.
 ----- 
 Sudden lucky breaks could come your way today, Scorpio, possibly through friends or groups with which you're involved. A long
 ----- 
 Today you might feel the desire to break free from your daily routine, Sagittarius, particularly regarding career matters. You might consider developing a business of your own, one that would give you a lot more freedom than you currently have. This is a good day to start looking into it. You might find that there are more possibilities out there than you expected.
 ----- 
 A sudden and unexpected opportunity to take a journey by air could come your way today, Capricorn. This might be something you've wanted for a long time finally manifesting. Certainly, adventure is in the air, although it might be mental adventure as much as physical. Some information could come your way that catapults you into a new and exciting field of interest. This promises to be a thoroughly stimulating day.
 ----- 
 Technology could pave the way for you to greatly increase your income, possibly through new skills or investments. This is likely to be a very positive development, setting the stage for future financial success. Some unusual, interesting dreams could come your way, bringing unexpected revelations about you and your past 
 ----- 
 The unexpected need to take a journey by air or spend a lot of time working could bring about an inconvenient separation from your partner. While the reasons for this situation and the projected outcome are very positive, it can cause a temporary upset in your relationship. Don't worry about it. The upset will pass, particularly when the desired results are attained. Concentrate on the matter at hand.
 ----- 
 Legal matters may be on your mind today, Aries. Maybe your insecurities are blowing a certain difficulty all out of proportion. You need to view the entire situation a little more objectively. If you can find someone in the know, ask him or her to fill you in on the facts. You will be relieved to know you've been making mountains out of molehills. For now, try to relax and lighten up a little.
 ----- 
 You may need someone's help or advice today, Taurus. Don't be afraid to ask for it. You tend to be proud of your ingenuity and independence. Most of the time others are the ones reaching out to you. You do have the right to ask for help. It isn't a sign of weakness. Knowing when to ask for help is a strength. Think about it.
 ----- 
 Is your significant other uncertain about spending much time with you today, Gemini? You may be hurt at first, as your honey could feel obligated to spend some private time with family members. You should be able to get together as you hoped. Just don't expect it to be for the whole day. Spend your alone time relaxing and sprucing yourself up.
 ----- 
 Are you doing something special for the people you live with tonight, Cancer? If so, you might be a little worried about what they might think of your skills as a chef, host, etc. Don't waste any time worrying. A good time will be had by all, including you. Everyone is likely to have a memorable evening. Just do your best, be your usual jovial self, and concentrate on having fun.
 ----- 
 A small gathering may take place in your neighborhood today if at all possible, Leo. If you're currently involved, you will probably attend it with your significant other. If you aren't seeing anyone, you will run into some old friends and possibly make some new ones. One of them could be a potential love interest, perhaps a little older than you. Relax, let loose, and have a little fun.
 ----- 
 Conversations of various kinds could take place today, Virgo. Some older people, perhaps your parents, could call you. It may be a rather quiet visit, with conversation that's more casual than intense, but it will be nice, nonetheless. Later you could get in touch with friends or colleagues to offer congratulations regarding something exciting.
 ----- 
 Someone you've been expecting to call might not do so today, Libra, and this could worry you a little. Don't be too shy to pick up the phone and call. Your friend may have overslept or been too overwhelmed by work or family life. You haven't been forgotten. If you phone, this person will undoubtedly be glad to hear from you. After the conversation, go for a walk in your neighborhood.
 ----- 
 Worries about money could be on your mind today, Scorpio. A check you've been expecting may not have arrived. Perhaps a project you've taken on is taking longer to complete than you thought, and so expected funds are delayed. The key word to remember here is "delayed." It's late, not cancelled altogether. Be patient and don't waste any more time worrying!
 ----- 
 The desire to get together with friends is strong today, Sagittarius, but you might be unable to do it in the way you'd hoped. You could be delayed by leftover work or chores, or other restrictions could get in the way. Don't despair, however. You can still have fun as planned. Pitch into whatever needs to be done and get it out of the way. You might be able to do what you wanted to do after all.
 ----- 
 A career goal you've been hoping to reach may seem uncertain now, Capricorn. You could be wondering if your work has gone for naught. Don't think this way. There's a lot going on behind the scenes that you aren't aware of yet. When you hear about these developments, you will know that you're still in the running. Don't waste your whole day thinking about work. Try to relax. Tomorrow it may all come together.
 ----- 
 Are you spending a lot of time working on something you've been trying to learn well? It could be more confusing than usual today, Aquarius. You might come across a new concept that doesn't quite make sense to you at first glance. Don't waste time puzzling over it. Think about something else. The meaning of it all should come to you out of the blue. Be patient.
 ----- 
 Did you wake up this morning with a vague recollection of a half
 ----- 
 Demands made by friends, children, or the special person in your life might have you feeling like you're moving in a dozen different directions at once. You may feel unfocused and scattered. You usually enjoy serving others, Aries, but today you need to concentrate a little more on yourself. Show others how to help themselves and then go and do something you want to do. You deserve it!
 ----- 
 A number of deliveries, service people, emails, or phone calls might keep you jumping today, Taurus, right when you're in the mood for a quiet day. It may take all your effort to keep your cool. Try to get a family member to intercede for you with some of these people or you might lose your temper. In the evening, watch a movie and relax.
 ----- 
 A close friend might pass along some seemingly harmless but nonetheless untrue gossip, Gemini. Don't accept anything you hear today until you check the facts for yourself. Any information you receive is likely to be exaggerated if not totally false. You might find a lot of material on subjects that interest you 
 ----- 
 You don't normally tend toward frugality, Cancer, but today you could go overboard with your spending. Frustration from all sides makes you want to release it all at once by acquiring new possessions. This is fine up to a point. Treat yourself but take care that you curb the impulse buying. You don't want to waste any time tomorrow taking unwanted items back to the store.
 ----- 
 Some failures that you may have experienced over the past few days could have you beating yourself up today, Leo. Perhaps you feel that you were too hasty or too sloppy and could have done things better. Don't obsess over it. Figure out what went wrong, learn from it, and let it go. Too much negativity directed at yourself is likely to sabotage future efforts rather than help them.
 ----- 
 Today you might be able to tune in to the thoughts and feelings of others, Virgo, but you aren't likely to know exactly how to handle the situation. Should you say something or just tailor your own behavior to suit the moods of others? Reflect on the situation before doing either. This is a great day to meditate or read books or attend online lectures on spiritual matters.
 ----- 
 Group activities are probably very much on your agenda today, Libra. You could attend an online meeting or lecture and later participate in a group chat with a bunch of friends. Don't be tempted to eat or drink too much. You'll likely regret it tomorrow. An unexpected sum of extra money could come your way. Don't spend it all in one place. This is a great day to concentrate on having fun 
 ----- 
 Too much pressure on the job could have you feeling like chucking it all and going somewhere by yourself. You might be tempted to go on a spending spree or overindulge in food or drink. This may spill over into your personal relationships, causing disagreements with friends or family. It might be a good idea to be alone for a few hours, Scorpio. You will feel much better once you clear your head.
 ----- 
 Inner conflict regarding spiritual matters might have you questioning your and others' beliefs. You might doubt just about everything, Sagittarius, and you could be tempted into angry debates over different concepts. Books or TV documentaries on whatever is bothering you might spark your curiosity and calm you down a little. A legal matter might come to the forefront today. It's a hassle, but it needs to be handled.
 ----- 
 Although your financial situation appears to be on the upswing, you still might be feeling pessimistic and indifferent about money and life in general. You might want to soothe your discontent by overspending, overindulging in food or drink, or both. Don't let this feeling get the better of you, Capricorn. Get together with some friends, if possible, and have a good time. Treat yourself to a little something without going over the top!
 ----- 
 A minor and rather silly quarrel with a friend or romantic partner could have you down in the dumps. This is an overreaction, Aquarius. You might need to get away for a while before you can make sense of it all. Too many demands from others could have you feeling used, and you might be tempted to tell them off. Try to avoid others long enough to gain control of yourself.
 ----- 
 Pressures on the job may be mounting. You might feel so disgruntled that you want to chuck it all and run away. Foreign countries and distant states may suddenly seem far more appealing than usual. Maybe it's a good idea to plan a future vacation, Pisces. The stresses you've been experiencing could adversely affect your health. You need to release them somehow. Give it some thought.
 ----- 
 Difficult challenges that have been lingering on the sidelines will probably become more prominent today, Aries. There is a strong possibility that things will come to a head. The problem was easy to overlook at first, but now that it has taken on a life of its own, you may have to consult someone who is more of an expert on these types of situations than you are.
 ----- 
 You could be the one everyone runs to for advice today, Taurus. You're the one with all the answers who can easily pull the rabbit out of a hat. Trust your judgment and intellectual know
 ----- 
 You may get frustrated when you find that people aren't as sensitive to a situation as you want them to be, Gemini. While you're looking to make a strong connection with someone, almost wanting to take possession of his or her feelings, that person, in turn, is trying to pull back. People are apt to gravitate toward rational facts rather than intense, smothering emotions.
 ----- 
 A small spark in a dry field is apt to whip the hill into flames, Cancer. A raging wildfire may be underway by the end of the day. Know that you're one of the biggest perpetrators, but don't feel badly about it. Fire is destructive but also necessary. Clearing out brush and offering a fresh new place in which new growth can flourish is an important part of the cycle of nature.
 ----- 
 Put on some lively music you can dance to and really kick up your heels, Leo. It's time to put away the sour mood and have fun. You will find that the more you engage in intellectual discussions with people today, the more you will get warmed up to the idea that life should be fun, not the pain and stress you sometimes make it out to be.
 ----- 
 This is a tremendously expansive time for you, Virgo, and there is very little that will stop your momentum once you get going. Your eyes are alive with a spark that says that you're ready to take on the world. Believe this about yourself and others will believe in you. There is a great deal of luck on your side today, so take a gamble in a certain part of your life.
 ----- 
 This is a good time to put things in writing, Libra. Your gift with words is apt to shine today as you write a proposal, email, or love poem. You're able to communicate very well when you put your sensitive emotions aside and concentrate on what you think instead of what you feel. Expand your influence by focusing on those things that require a more cerebral approach.
 ----- 
 The day's energy is apt to be lively, making it much easier to get the things done that you need to do, Scorpio. You will find people are more than eager to help you. The trick is to integrate your leadership abilities with the knowledge available from other people. You will create a winning combination of power and strength to put to use in just about any realm of your life.
 ----- 
 Obstacles that you have ignored are suddenly starting to expand beyond reasonable proportions, Sagittarius. Be careful of what you say as a result, because your words could spread like wildfire. This is no laughing matter. Difficulties in your world are likely to crop up, and you will find your ego threatened. Try to keep some sort of emotional barrier.
 ----- 
 This is a terrific day for you, Capricorn, and you will glow brightly from head to toe as you radiate your true inner self to the world. You will find profound joy in the simplest, most ordinary circumstances. If you run out of things to say, feel free to whistle a tune. This isn't likely to happen today, since you will overflow with things to talk about.
 ----- 
 Tap into the boisterous, lighthearted mood of the day instead of getting bogged down with heavy emotions, Aquarius. This is a good time to engage your mind rather than let your heart take control. Be aware of the expansive nature of the day that allows you to think clearly without getting bothered by emotions. Take the cerebral route to figuring out what you need to do to smooth any bumps in the road.
 ----- 
 Your optimism will be inspiring today, Pisces. You will find that your lighthearted approach is perfectly suited to taking care of any issue that arises. Toss a few jokes into the mix and remind other people that it isn't necessary to take things so seriously. The sun is shining as you proudly parade down the street with your head held high.
 ----- 
 There should be no doubt in your mind about which way to proceed, Aries. Don't let self
 ----- 
 Your rock
 ----- 
 Your ship is finally coming into port after being out in rough seas for so long, Gemini. It's time to dock the boat for a while. Relax and explore the area. There is nothing wrong with getting off your vessel for a while. You may not even realize how much you've missed solid ground until now. Remember what it's like to be stable again.
 ----- 
 You may still be on something of a high from the last couple weeks. You will definitely be tempted to let the good times continue to roll, Cancer. Think about ways you can keep them rolling while still maintaining good judgment. Don't let things get too out of control today. It's important that you maintain a bit of stability at all times.
 ----- 
 Communicate from a centered space today, Leo. Fortunately, the nature of the day caters to your needs and desires. You shouldn't have to work too hard to get what you want. Things should come to you naturally. You may wonder why you got stressed out before over what now seem to be small issues. Consciously release the worry and concern that are still stored in your body.
 ----- 
 Work toward achieving a better unity between you and the people around you, Virgo. It could be that certain people in your circle of friends somehow feel alienated in one way or another. Perhaps they don't feel like they fit in with the rest of the group. Remind yourself and others that everyone is unique and that all should be equally accepted despite individual differences.
 ----- 
 You will feel much better about yourself if you get things done today, Libra. Like a meal that tastes good but isn't necessarily good for you, you might enjoy this day by being lazy, but you won't feel so good when night comes and you realize that you haven't accomplished anything. Use the day productively so you have a sense of fulfillment by tonight.
 ----- 
 You might consider taking a rest today, Scorpio. Like a sailboat on the ocean, you've been taxed lately by all the turbulence. The pressure on you has been tremendous. Think about pulling your sails to half
 ----- 
 Your thinking is apt to be quite clear and rational today, Sagittarius. This is especially important since others will be looking for your thoughts and opinions on a certain matter. People will know that they can get a straight and honest answer from you, so don't disappoint them. Think through each situation clearly before you offer your advice. You will find that it's worth the effort.
 ----- 
 By being around negative and flip people, you might inadvertently pick up these habits. Be careful about your associates, Capricorn, because you will find that others judge you according to the company you keep, especially if you start talking like them. Make sure to maintain a respectful attitude and proper manners no matter who your company is.
 ----- 
 You may feel like the world is caving in on you in many ways today, Aquarius. It could be that you've recently dug your own little cave to crawl into and be safe from the outside world. Realize that the deeper you dig in unstable terrain, the more unsteady the walls. If you aren't careful, it's likely to come crashing down on top of you.
 ----- 
 Remember that you can only remain in charge as long as the others around you support your personality and leadership abilities, Pisces. Avoid mutiny by taking care of the people in your world instead of simply trying to run their lives. Gain respect with kind words and a sensitive attitude rather than by enforcing harsh rules and regulations that restrict and aggravate.
 ----- 
 You've had a strong propensity for war lately, Aries. Your drive toward getting things done has rallied and you're anxious to make progress. The problem is that you might have to hold back a bit today, since there is a great force at work encouraging to you to take a break from your current trajectory. Slow down and make a plan instead of just plowing blindly ahead toward the unknown.
 ----- 
 Your balancing powers will be put to the test today when your desire to fight conflicts with your need to plan, Taurus. You might be even more indecisive than usual as a result of this internal tension. Be aware of time and the restrictions that it puts on you. Devise a plan that uses your energy in the most efficient way possible. It's especially important for you to think before you act.
 ----- 
 Try not to get too frustrated by the indecisiveness that plagues you today, Gemini. The longer you stand still, the harder it will be to get moving. The key is to find a balance between planning and forcefulness. There's an incredible need for you make progress now. If you're met with resistance, you should probably just back off for now. Fighting won't yield positive results now.
 ----- 
 Indecisiveness could be your biggest nemesis today, Cancer. The general tone of the day is apt to be quite explosive as a feeling of restriction and discipline comes into conflict with a need to fight and conquer. You might find that your go
 ----- 
 Your plans meet with harsh opposition today, Leo. You've been going along at a slow and steady pace, but you will find that abrasive tension arises the more you try to force your will on others. Gridlock is quite likely due to the fact that there are strong forces coming to a head. Neither one of them is in the mood to yield now.
 ----- 
 Getting your opinions out now may stir up the maelstrom even more, but ultimately, it's for the best, Virgo. There is an explosive tone in the air right now that's difficult to ignore. You need your strong will to combat the abrasive forces at work today. You have the opportunity to initiate control over the situation. Other people might be too unsure of themselves to make a move.
 ----- 
 Your best plan of attack today is to not attack at all, Libra. There is enough aggressiveness out there. You don't need to add any more to the fray. Let others duke it out. Your job is to wait until the dust settles. Try not to get involved in other people's disputes. You might get dragged further into the situation than makes you feel comfortable.
 ----- 
 You might need to put on the brakes today, Scorpio. Your present trajectory isn't quite in line with the people and energy around you. Make sure you aren't stepping on other people's toes with your abrasive behavior. This is a day to consider a more disciplined approach. You might need to establish a better structure, so you use your energy more efficiently in general.
 ----- 
 If you've been reluctant to make a move, Sagittarius, you should consider why. What has been holding you back? Fear of failure? A negative comment from someone else? Feeling like you aren't quite prepared for the consequences of your actions? It's time to free yourself of these mental barriers that keep you from making progress. Don't let self
 ----- 
 Discipline and a solid plan are your friends today, Capricorn. Slow your approach and consider the consequences of your actions. This is the time to concentrate on what you need to get done and devise a plan to make it happen. There is restlessness in the air that might cause you to act hastily. Don't forget the old saying that says haste makes waste. This is an important lesson.
 ----- 
 You might experience a bit of an internal conflict today and be you're unsure how to proceed, Aquarius. One side feels an urge to fight, while another side 
 ----- 
 It may be hard to connect with others today, Pisces. People may be rather indecisive. On the other hand, people are apt to be more malleable. This could be a good time to take charge. Be sure that you keep in mind the best interests of all parties involved. It isn't fair for you to take advantage of people who can't make up their own minds about something.
 ----- 
 You might want to escape the frenzy of the day by going shopping, Aries. Align yourself with partners and allies who share your views. Try to keep the disagreements to a minimum. There is enough tension and war raging in the world around you today that you don't need to add to the negative force by contributing disputes and ailments to the situation.
 ----- 
 Your mood should be quite good today, Taurus, although there may be some strong forces at work trying to subvert this positive attitude. Try not to let other people's disagreements bring you down. Take the high ground and you will certainly prevail. A peaceful nature is extremely important in order to balance the anger and hostility that's present all around. Be the one to promote this harmony.
 ----- 
 Today's arena is one in which you can find a great deal of material, Gemini. There will be no shortage of energy to work with or opinions coming from you. Realize that your words have a greater potency about them as people become more intent on uncovering the truth. Apply yourself to peace and cooperation among groups. Help people work together toward a common goal.
 ----- 
 Peace and harmony are in the regularly scheduled program for the day, but there is a good chance that there could be a warring force with strong opinions and vindictive tendencies. Hold onto your hat, Cancer, and make sure you have your actions well aligned with your soul or else you could be thrown into a battle that has nothing to do with you.
 ----- 
 I told you so might be your motto of the day. Try not to rub this in other people's faces, Leo. Indeed, you have the foresight to witness an action and see the consequences right away. These consequences might rear their ugly heads on a day like this. Use your incredible perception and intuition to home in on the best solution possible and work toward that goal before things get out of hand.
 ----- 
 You may know exactly the right thing to do today, but for some reason, the action required may be a hard thing for you to implement, Virgo. Take an active role to get involved. Say your peace, but don't get so attached to the results that you get upset and discouraged if things don't exactly work out according to plan. Independence is an important virtue to hold onto today.
 ----- 
 Make sure your opinion doesn't get lost in the frenzy of the day, Libra. Your words may not quite fit with the things that people want to hear. Try not to take this personally. Realize that this isn't an indication that your words are any less important. You have an incredible gift of being able to see things that others can't. Cherish and nourish this ability instead of invalidating it.
 ----- 
 You have two choices today. Either jump into the thick of the mess with both feet or stay out of it altogether. There are definitely two distinct camps setting up their arsenals for battle. Realize that there is also a soft, tender, harmonious aspect that just wants peace. It will be hard to ignore the fact that your usual warring nature is ready to do battle.
 ----- 
 You may end up being the peaceful savior that calms everyone down today, Sagittarius. Use your artistic nature and love of beauty and harmony to inspire others to put away their differences and concentrate on the positive aspects. Generous acceptance of others is the only way to go, especially today, when people are riled up and ready to fight. Do your best to promote peace.
 ----- 
 Your unique ability to communicate with many different groups and personalities will be extremely important today to maintaining a bridge between warring camps, Capricorn. Keep things moving and try not to let the situation stagnate on any one issue. If the conversation turns to raging and ranting, it's in your best interests to stop it right away. Don't be afraid to step up and take a leadership role.
 ----- 
 You might feel like you're getting worked up from all angles today, Aquarius. Find comfort in knowing that things will definitely improve by tomorrow. You might get the feeling that somehow you're all alone despite the circle of friends that surrounds and loves you. You may be called to action by a strong force. Try to stay abreast of information and developments around you so you can make the most informed decisions possible.
 ----- 
 Try to rise above the potential tension and rough spots of the day, Pisces. Do yourself a favor and don't feel like you have to stoop to another's level. Take pride in your actions and do things with confidence. Work with the negativity. The worst thing to do would be to ignore it. Approach problems squarely as soon as they arise. Don't dredge up the past. It's time to move forward.
 ----- 
 Answers may not be crystal clear today, Aries. They probably won't be laid out in a neat and organized manner. Get out in the open air and join friends for a long bike ride. Fly a kite or feel the wind blow through your hair on top of a mountain peak. The answer is flowing through the air around you. Stop looking down at the ground for the information you seek.
 ----- 
 Your head should be quite clear today, Taurus, and your witty comments will be met with appreciation and laughter. Your smile will delight everyone you encounter. Don't be afraid to let your feelings out to those who need to hear them. Focus your energy on the ones you love. Your heart is warm and generous, so share it with other people today.
 ----- 
 Don't worry about probing too deeply today, Gemini. Trust people more than you normally would. You will find that things go much more smoothly if you approach them from a neutral or positive and not accusatory position. Listen to the people you care about the most. They're trying to convey important information. You might not want to hear it now, but in the long run, it's in everyone's best interests that you do.
 ----- 
 You might consider taking a short trip today, Cancer. Perhaps you need to get out of the house and go across town. Whatever it is, introduce your brain to a new reality. It's time to expand and explore. You itch to see new places and experience new things, either physically or mentally. Perhaps a religious sanctuary or quiet place in grove of trees is what you need in order to quench this inner thirst.
 ----- 
 Your mind might be stimulated today, Leo, so stay alert and open to new information. If you feel tired, take a short nap. It's better to operate at top speed and full capacity than go through your day only half present. Don't rely on external stimulants like caffeine to pick you up. These things will deceive your body and do damage to your nervous system.
 ----- 
 Communication is flowing smoothly today, Virgo, so take advantage of this and get the word out. It's important for you to make connections with other people now. Run with your instincts and feel free to enter into debates. Your words and tone of voice are very convincing. You could sell anything to anyone today.
 ----- 
 Don't let fear of failure or fear of success hold you back, Libra. Even though you may feel a natural tendency to want to shrink into the background and take the easiest route, you might be sacrificing your true purpose when you do. Become the leader instead of following the leader. Rid yourself of all fear and take control of your destiny.
 ----- 
 Powerful thoughts are running through your brain. You will find that this information can be transforming, Scorpio. The key is to learn from others and incorporate opposing viewpoints into your state of mind. Don't automatically disregard the opinion of another just because it contradicts your own beliefs. Teamwork is the name of the game on a day like today.
 ----- 
 Information coming your way today might be unreliable, Sagittarius. It could be hard for you to take a solid hold on the messages you get. Keep in mind that there are important answers waiting to be heard. These answers will come to you when you least expect them. Keep your mind open to new possibilities and the path will open up and become clear. Don't compromise your consciousness with abusive substances.
 ----- 
 Be careful about being manipulated by another person today, Capricorn. It's possible that someone is putting words in your mouth in order to get you to act a certain way. Don't fall into this trap. Be your own person and think for yourself. Your mind is susceptible and vulnerable now. Use your eyes and ears as a filter and don't let people unload their garbage on you.
 ----- 
 Information you receive today may get you stirred up, Aquarius. Remember that it takes two to start an argument. You play an equal part in any disagreement. If you want to promote peace and harmony, your words and body language must show this. If peace and harmony aren't your ultimate goal, you may need to look inside yourself to explore the reasons why.
 ----- 
 There's a great deal of power to your words today, Pisces, so be careful how you use them. You may end up manipulating another's choices if you aren't careful with your conduct. Make sure you give others the freedom and empowerment to decide things for themselves. Be open and honest about all the facts that might influence their decisions in any way.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if the old
 ----- 
 You may be able to zip through chores like lightning today, Taurus. There's an added swiftness to your step that helps in every one of your endeavors. You might want to engage in just about every activity except work. This is completely understandable. You will feel much better if you get your work done first and then socialize. That plan will produce the best results.
 ----- 
 You're likely to go to extremes today on many levels, Gemini. The problem is that you may encounter opposition everywhere you turn. There's an incredible stubbornness to the day that is evident in everyone's mood, especially yours. Keep in mind that if you want cooperation and resolution, you will need to compromise. Try to see other people's needs as well.
 ----- 
 Grab hold of the day's boisterous energy and run with it, Cancer. This is a good time to kick up your heels and have fun. You might find that people are a bit more high
 ----- 
 You might be frustrated by the fact that people are doing things hastily today, Leo. You might have to accept the fast
 ----- 
 People may come into conflict with you today, Virgo. More than likely, the issue at hand will have to do with others being a bit too focused on themselves, while you're more concerned with the collective. Try to be a bit more understanding as people demand more of your attention. There's an unmistakable passion in the air that will grant you more zest for life.
 ----- 
 Jump
 ----- 
 There could be an unexpected tension coming out of nowhere today, Scorpio. More than likely your emotions will be running at a high level. It could be that your aggressiveness and assertiveness start to annoy others. People might snap suddenly. Don't be surprised if things come without much warning. There is a fast
 ----- 
 Your slow and steady approach might be met with a bit of opposition today, Sagittarius. People could be demanding of your time and energy. It's one of those days in which the people behind you in line at a coffee shop might give you dirty looks if you take too long to make up your mind.
 ----- 
 This is a terrific day for you, Capricorn, and you will find that the fast pace of the day suits you well for what you need to get done. There's a general feeling of grandeur in the air that reminds you to take your time when getting dressed. Feel free to go all out today. Put on a lavish display wherever you go.
 ----- 
 Do your best to keep up today, Aquarius. Things might move quickly. You may be raising your hand and waiting politely for someone to call on you. This is one of those days in which other people will be so concerned about themselves that they probably won't notice you at all. If you want to take your turn, you should probably just stand up and be proactive.
 ----- 
 This is a good time to take control of the situation, Pisces. You've done your preparation and now it's time to put it to good use. You're about to face your enemy eye to eye. Have confidence in your training. There's an extra alertness to you that helps you fight any battles. You have a strong awareness of the energy around you, so use this to your advantage.
 ----- 
 A friend could tell you about an exciting new person for whom you feel a very powerful physical attraction when you see their picture, Aries. Your first conversation could prove exciting but stay calm and remain objective. If your feelings are too obvious, he or she could well lose interest before anything has time to develop! Just be yourself, enjoy the discussion, and have fun. That's all you need do at this point.
 ----- 
 Some exciting career developments could have you flying high today, Taurus. Perhaps you've just reached a long
 ----- 
 Tonight, you might decide to attend a small group activity of some kind, if possible, perhaps one concerned with philosophical or spiritual matters, Gemini. Everyone who attends is apt to feel very strongly about the subject, so discussions could prove lively and exciting. Your mind could be spinning like a top when you leave, so if you can, walk home so you can clear your head. Write down your thoughts. You will want to remember them.
 ----- 
 Your financial situation could be greatly boosted by a development you hadn't expected, Cancer. Perhaps some investments suddenly skyrocket in value, or maybe the homes in your neighborhood are suddenly worth more than you thought. Whichever it is, don't try to cash in on it right now. Chances are the value of your investment will continue to increase. Hang in there and watch it grow.
 ----- 
 A legal matter that may have been pending for a while could finally be completed today, Leo. It's very likely to go in your favor. Therefore, if you've been sitting on a contract, agreement, or other document that needs your signature, read it carefully before you sign. You will probably get what you want out of the transaction. By the way, this is also a great day to get married!
 ----- 
 Your physical energy is likely to be high today, Virgo, so you might not feel like staying indoors. Take care of your body first, and get in a good workout. You may also want to explore, perhaps by driving out of town for the day or going to an amusement park, if possible. You may not feel this energetic very often, so it's best to make the most of it when you can.
 ----- 
 An exciting rush of physical passion could hit you today when you're introduced to an interesting new person, Libra. Take care not to wear it on your face. You generally don't like to reveal that much of yourself! Besides, you won't want this person to think you're too obvious. Try to stay focused and remain objective. Then consider whether it's a good idea to pursue this attraction.
 ----- 
 Chores that need to be done around the house could be at the top of your priority list today, Scorpio. A female visitor, perhaps your mother, could come by and making your place look great will preoccupy you. Don't do any more work than you absolutely have to. You won't want to be too tired when she arrives.
 ----- 
 Today you may have some important phone calls to make, Sagittarius, and want to get them out of the way before doing anything else. You will definitely get your message across because your communicative abilities are very strong. Words combine with feelings to create understanding between you and just about anyone, whether you're talking on the phone or writing.
 ----- 
 Good news about money could create some excitement in your household today, Capricorn. One of your goals might be to invest some of the funds in fixing up your living situation. You might even consider moving or purchasing a new home. You may kick around a lot of ideas about how to spend the windfall, but don't go too crazy. Hold on to some of that money as a nest egg.
 ----- 
 An intriguing new neighbor, perhaps someone you're attracted to, could move in near you, Aquarius. This might prove very exciting. You will probably strike up a conversation and enjoy talking with him or her. Whether you choose to pursue this attraction depends on both of your current situations, but at the very least, you will make a new friend.
 ----- 
 Your intuitive abilities should be operating at a very high level today, Pisces. You might inadvertently receive some positive psychic messages about your future, and this could prove very exciting. These insights could be a source of inspiration that propels you to accomplish wonders in some aspect of your life. This could turn out to be a self
 ----- 
 There is some likelihood that the mood at home is fraught with tension. Did you have some intellectual disagreement? In any case, it looks as though your self
 ----- 
 It seems that your sensitivity is in slight conflict with your actions, Taurus. You continue to go through the daily motions and do what you planned on doing, but it seems as though your heart is no longer in it. Don't ask why. It's just that you've been working hard and thinking hard lately. You've reached your limit and it's time to rest.
 ----- 
 You may have been spending or saving too much money, Gemini. It's clear that a rebalancing is in order if you're to find pleasure rather than frustration. It's a curious phenomenon, as though you've lost contact with your body. Yet it's in your body where you will ultimately find your balance. You certainly won't find it in your head!
 ----- 
 Perhaps you've been impatiently waiting for the moment to jump into new adventures after your meditation during the last few months. Know that the moment has almost arrived! You now have the strategy, objective, and means at your disposal to succeed. Just a bit more work remains to be done. Gather your strength and get ready to act with renewed vigor.
 ----- 
 If you find yourself tired and irritable at the moment, Leo, you should know that this is normal. You may have had a few weeks that were a little too studious. Would you like to continue on the same path? Be careful that your ambitions don't lead you to serious physical exhaustion, Leo. You'll be even more frustrated if you get sick. So be wise and take care of your basic needs.
 ----- 
 This is going to be a good moment to look elsewhere, Virgo. You should do just as the artist does when he has worked too long on a painting, which is to take a step back. You need to clear your head. Go for a walk. Call a mentor. Text with an artist friend. Breaks are never easy for you, but do it anyway. Afterwards you'll think it was the best thing for you.
 ----- 
 This is the right moment to extricate yourself from relationships that have seen their day, Libra. This won't be easy, but you must. In your professional and private lives, you're too hesitant to get out of distasteful situations or obligations. You're afraid of hurting people or making them mad. But in the end, you're hurting yourself. Give more weight to your own needs and follow your own path.
 ----- 
 You took off like a bullet a few days ago, making great progress in a short amount of time. Now you're grappling with doubts that are undermining all of your energy. Reflecting on the events of the past few days, it's obvious that you were somewhat reckless in your headlong pursuit of your goals. Don't give up, Scorpio. Rethink your strategy.
 ----- 
 There is some likelihood that you will be haunted by thoughts of your love life today, Sagittarius. Perhaps you're intrigued by the idea of exploring certain secret realms of your relationship, yet you aren't sure how to communicate this to your mate. Perhaps you're still testing the waters, waiting until you know how you feel. In any case, you might decide to proceed today.
 ----- 
 Today, more than ever, you will yearn to escape the daily routine, Capricorn. You thirst for new sights and sounds, new faces and new places, but you know you must juggle your desires with professional and domestic obligations. It isn't always easy. Trust your imagination to find a way to settle this conflict.
 ----- 
 You're finally on the mend, Aquarius. The minor ailments that may have dragged you down lately are beginning to disappear. You're about to regain all of your physical energy. If you overindulge, your energy level is likely to plummet once again. If nothing else, you will have learned a valuable lesson about the importance of moderation, especially now. Don't overdo it!
 ----- 
 Do you feel a little under the weather today, Pisces? It's quite possible, considering all the emotional turmoil you've been through lately. It takes time to recover from such storms. As you know, the work itself isn't what gets you down. It's worry about the future that drains your energy. Give yourself a break today. Take some time for rest and recuperation.
 ----- 
 Career and financial success might have paved the way for you to fulfill some of your fondest dreams, Aries. Perhaps you've wanted to return to college and get an advanced degree, explore new cultures or try writing and publishing. Whatever it is, your schedule should be freer and more flexible than ever, so this is the time to go for it. Start planning today!
 ----- 
 Now that you feel more secure regarding your business and financial situations, Taurus, you might be looking for ways to feed your spiritual and metaphysical interests. Your intuitive and psychic abilities should be operating at a very high level, causing you to experience some vivid dreams and visions and receive the insights that come from them. Books and online lectures might prove especially enlightening.
 ----- 
 Just about every department of life should be going very well for you now, Gemini. Business, finances, and partnerships are likely on their way to success, while personal relationships of all kinds, particularly romantic ones, should also be more rewarding. You might be thinking of expanding your horizons through new enterprises or study. Don't be shy 
 ----- 
 Whatever you're working on at the moment, Cancer, whether business related, personal projects, or volunteer work, it's likely to bring you increased satisfaction on many levels. You're enjoying what you do, making a difference, and interacting with new friends. Your health continues to glow. You may feel as if nothing can stop you. Watch out for minor upsets, but nothing that will burst your bubble.
 ----- 
 It's likely that your personal and creative horizons are expanding, Leo. Your or another's artistic enterprises might pay off big today. You could be introduced to people who prove to be valuable contacts as well as new friends. Your love relationships are going well. Your new feeling of enthusiasm and self
 ----- 
 If possible, a get
 ----- 
 Expect many advantageous changes to take place in your community, Libra. New businesses could open their doors, interesting neighbors could move in, or some necessary repairs could finally get done. You might spend a lot of time in the car or on the phone and spreading the news. An exciting proposition may come to you or someone close to you through a letter, email, or phone call.
 ----- 
 You've probably had few periods when business and finance have gone well for you, Scorpio. Now this trend seems to be coming to a head. Today you might start or close some type of agreement that will make a big difference to your finances. Your money situation should not only improve but also stabilize at a level higher than it's ever been. As long as you're diligent, this growth should continue.
 ----- 
 You tend to be practical and businesslike by nature, Sagittarius, but the tremendous growth you've experienced may increase your desire to be as sensible and efficient as possible in order to continue this trend. You're feeling upbeat and positive. You're likely to continue to feel this way. The only downside is that you're probably going to be working very hard. You will like the results, though, so go for it.
 ----- 
 You probably think of yourself as a curious intellectual, Capricorn, but a recent expansion in career and finance has brought out talents for business and money that you didn't know you had. This has been a time not only of success and good fortune but also of learning more about yourself. Don't fall back on old fears or underestimate yourself. You're capable of accomplishing more than you know.
 ----- 
 Your natural warmth is enhanced by a new sense of self
 ----- 
 Today you might pinch yourself to see if what you're experiencing is real, Pisces. Success and good fortune are coming thick and fast, with only minor setbacks and irritations to complicate matters. Business, money, and career success are likely to be at an all
 ----- 
 A book or movie about a foreign country could capture your imagination and make that country seem especially appealing, Aries. You might toy with the idea of taking a trip there in the future. If you're serious, it might be a good idea to start making your tentative plans. You're in a particularly practical frame of mind and have the enthusiasm to do it. Have fun browsing through travel brochures and maps.
 ----- 
 Someone close who owes you money might suddenly turn up and repay you, Taurus. This might be a surprise, but you will be glad to get it. You may want to blow some of it by taking a friend out to lunch or buying someone a gift. Some beautiful dreams could haunt your sleep tonight, perhaps to the point where you feel frustrated when you wake up. Write them down. They're saying something about you.
 ----- 
 Today you should feel especially warm and loving toward everyone close to you, Gemini, particularly a love partner. You may want to spend some time with friends or family, if possible, or schedule a romantic evening with your significant other 
 ----- 
 You should be looking especially attractive today and glowing with robust health, Cancer. You're apt to feel warm and loving, particularly toward small animals. If you've considered adopting a pet, this is a good day to do it. Business, work, and money matters continue to go well. You should be in a pretty good space. This frame of mind should last you a long time.
 ----- 
 Today you should be feeling especially warm and loving toward close friends and children, Leo. You could also especially appreciate the arts. You might attend a play or concert or decide to try your hand at one of the fine arts yourself. In the evening, go out and enjoy your friends' company, if possible. Celebrate just being together in whatever way you can!
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to buy a plant for every room in your house or plant a garden, Virgo. If the weather is good, you might visit a nursery or botanical garden. You may not normally be attracted to plants and gardens, but today both beauty and nature seem especially appealing. Make the most of this, however temporary. Your house will look that much more beautiful because of it!
 ----- 
 A warm and loving communication could come to you today from someone close. This could be an email, call, or even a gift of some kind. This could make your day, Libra, and you will probably pass whatever good feelings you draw from it to other friends and family members. Take a walk around your neighborhood and say hello to whomever you meet. It will make you feel even better!
 ----- 
 A very welcome sum of extra money could come your way today, Scorpio, possibly out of the blue. You might want to put this money to work for you in some way, perhaps investing it or purchasing supplies or materials for personal projects. You should feel especially positive where your resources are concerned, and confident in your ability to earn.
 ----- 
 Today you may feel especially warm and loving toward just about everybody in your circle, Sagittarius, even those you usually find irritating. You could also be looking especially attractive and feeling more confident than usual. You might even feel like shopping for new clothes. Artistic ideas could flow freely, and you might think of different ways to put them to work for you.
 ----- 
 Someone you care about but haven't seen for a long time could suddenly contact you. You'd usually love this, Capricorn, but today you could be too caught up in projects of your own to want to put them aside. But you will have a lot of fun with this person, and you might even interest him or her in your project. After finishing your work, get some delicious takeout.
 ----- 
 A goal that you've been working on could finally be reached, Aquarius. A group of friends you might not have seen for a long time could schedule a small get
 ----- 
 Today you could talk to some interesting new people, Pisces. Among them is at least one person who shares a lot of your interests and could become a close friend. The joy you receive from communicating with these people is likely to spill over into the rest of your day. You could be warmer and more congenial with everyone else in your life, too. In the evening, have some fun.
 ----- 
 A lot of paperwork might need attention today, Aries. You might throw a lot of your focus and energy into getting it all done. Stimulating conversations with colleagues could keep your mind occupied so you avoid boredom. You could take a walk at the end of the day since you're apt to encounter so much new information that you will want to clear your head in order to absorb it all.
 ----- 
 Expanding your mind could be of interest today, Taurus. You might decide to plan a trip to a place you've always wanted to visit, if possible. Or you could decide to go back to school for an advanced degree. Either way, you're likely to spend the day considering the idea and doing a lot of research. At some point you will want to get in a workout to rid your system of some of the day's tension.
 ----- 
 Generally, Gemini, you tend to be interested in what makes everything tick, from the human mind to the workings of the Universe to religion. Today that interest could be piqued by something you read or hear. You might want to delve into a field of interest and learn whatever you can about it. You could have some insights that are as valid as anyone else's, so write them down!
 ----- 
 Stimulating conversations could take place with partners of all sorts, Cancer, from business to exercise to romantic. Some new and useful information could come your way that you will want to explore further. This is a great day to execute legal papers or enter into any kind of agreement or commitment. It's a good time to sign up for an online class or workshop. Make good use of the energies of the day.
 ----- 
 Some stimulating discussions could take place today. Your energy is likely to be very high, Leo. You may want to throw yourself into your work, particularly if it involves paperwork. You might also want to get in a workout, try your hand at writing, or read about the latest discoveries concerning optimal health. Books, magazines, and the Internet could prove especially useful.
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to do some writing, Virgo. This could be job related, but it's more likely personal, either correspondence with friends and colleagues or creative. Some stimulating discussion could take place with friends, romantic partners, or children that could set your mind buzzing with new ideas. This is a great day to attend or participate in a solo sport.
 ----- 
 Some people who share your interests could call you today. You might want to take a walk while on the phone with each other, but you will probably get into some stimulating debates. Don't be surprised if you both talk at once! New books that you will want to read could come to your attention. In the evening, stream some movies on whatever subject you've discussed.
 ----- 
 Your mind will be especially quick and active today, Scorpio, and you're likely to want to spend much of the day involved in intellectual activities like reading, writing, or teaching. Communication with others should be a powerful part of your day, so you will probably spend time on the phone. You will want to write down many of the ideas you hear. You will find most of them interesting and want to remember them.
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to tackle your financial paperwork and get it all done. This is a great day for that, Sagittarius, although you might be a little too ambitious and not get as much done as you'd like. This is a good time to make use of any writing talent, because ideas could be coming to you thick and fast. Expect many of letters or phone calls in this busy and stimulating day.
 ----- 
 Your mind is usually quick, agile, and hungry for information, Capricorn. Today it's likely to be even more so than usual. Your curiosity is high, and you could go to unusual lengths to satisfy it. You might also feel particularly energetic and want to get in a good workout. This is a good idea. Exercise can clear your head and give you a better perspective on new ideas and information.
 ----- 
 You generally tend to be sensitive and intuitive, Aquarius, but today you might be even more so. Reading about people from other places and times might cause you to tune into their thoughts and feelings and receive new insight into human nature. Creative projects, particularly writing, benefit from this. If you want to remember what you come up with, write it down.
 ----- 
 A virtual group meeting or social event could bring up so many new and interesting ideas that you may not be able to digest them all, Pisces. Some new friends who share your interests might want to continue the discussions. Your mind is especially quick today. You could well grasp unusual concepts that usually don't interest you. But watch your step 
 ----- 
 Are things getting a little bit crazy, Aries? Too many tasks and too many people vying for your attention could have your nerves stretched as taut as violin strings. Try to get outside for a while. Treat yourself to a nice takeout lunch or do a little online shopping. Take a good long nap. Whatever seems so urgent isn't worth sacrificing your peace of mind. Try to stay focused!
 ----- 
 A rush of creative inspiration could take you temporarily away from your social life today, Taurus. At some point you could be working as if there were no tomorrow, perhaps worrying that you will forget it if you don't get it all down now. It's no use telling you to slow down. Be sure to keep sufficient snacks on hand and do take occasional breaks. Work hard and good luck!
 ----- 
 A small impromptu party may take place at your house today when some unexpected but welcome visitors turn up at your door. Follow current protocol. Expect the conversation to alternate between lots of laughs and discussion of some pretty serious subjects. The gathering could continue well into the night if you let it, but don't let it continue past the point of enjoyment. You can always do it again another time.
 ----- 
 Is a new neighbor moving in nearby, Cancer? This person could come from a very interesting locale, so you might want to get to know him or her. Don't expect to be able to do this today. This person may be in and out throughout the afternoon and too busy with settling in. Drop some cookies off some time over the next few days, however. You will be glad you did.
 ----- 
 Have you been spending too much lately, Leo? Today you could be feeling the effects of it. You may have to wait to make a purchase that you've wanted for a long time, and this could be frustrating. Don't worry about it, though. You will get through this unscathed, and the item will still be in the store when you have money again. Relax.
 ----- 
 Your sweetheart may seem upset today and unlikely to want to talk about it, Virgo. This could prove frustrating for you since you don't like to be kept in the dark. Take care to avoid giving in to the temptation to push. This won't make your partner any more likely to share, and it could drive a wedge between you. Just hang in there and let your friend talk when the time is right.
 ----- 
 Vague aches and pains could have you feeling a little under the weather, Libra. You may not be able to discern why you have these pains, since there's no apparent reason. Don't assume the worst. Your condition is probably just due to a little intensified nerve strain and extra stress. Take it easy and relax today. Go back to your usual routine tomorrow.
 ----- 
 Expect some delays, upsets, and unexpected turns when it comes to romance today, Scorpio. Jealousy may rear its ugly head, as you may at some point get the impression that your beloved is noticing someone else. Bear in mind that there's a strong chance that these impressions are illusory, and that the truth may be totally different from the way things seem. Take care to stay focused. Reserve judgment until you know the facts.
 ----- 
 Changes may be taking place on the home front, Sagittarius, perhaps unexpected repairs or someone moving in or out. Your household could seem frenetic and disorganized until the dust settles, which doesn't sit well with your love of peace and quiet. Whatever needs to be done is best accomplished one step at a time, with your mind focused on the results. It will help you stay sane!
 ----- 
 An unexpected and perhaps not altogether welcome call could come your way today, Capricorn. It could come from someone you don't particularly care for or someone who has some disconcerting news to report. Whichever it is, you will probably just have to deal with it. However, you may feel about the caller or what he or she has to report, you will probably consider it important to have the conversation.
 ----- 
 Worries about money that may have preoccupied you for the past day or so could prove unfounded, Aquarius. This should come as a real relief to you, although it may be difficult to grasp at first. Your mind is still getting in the way of accepting it. Go over your correspondence and bank records as many times as you want. The answer should be the same 
 ----- 
 A temporary separation from your romantic partner could have you agitated, Pisces. Are you worried that your friend has forgotten you? This is probably an overreaction, but your insecurities are getting the better of you. Find a distraction. Have faith. Phone calls from your friend should prove reassuring. Perhaps the only way to get past this is to stay busy until your partner returns.
 ----- 
 You may feel like you desperately need something, Aries, yet you're unsure as to what it is exactly. Someone close to you may be trying to fit the missing puzzle piece into place, but this may be next to impossible if it's unclear which piece is actually missing. This difficult situation may lead to frustration if you aren't careful. Feel free to admit that you feel powerless. Don't be ashamed to say so.
 ----- 
 You may want to remedy every situation by talking things out or taking some sort of action, Taurus. Be careful of making any sudden moves before you really understand what you're feeling. One minute you may be full of exuberance and ready to launch into a new project, but once you start moving forward, you're suddenly feeling insecure. Take this resistance as a sign that maybe this isn't the best time to move forward.
 ----- 
 Compliments are apt to feel like gold to you, Gemini. There's nothing you need more than love and affection on a day like this. Beware that you may end up as putty in the hands of whoever showers you with flattery. You may also resent this need for attention and not be willing to receive it graciously. This isn't the right attitude. Receive accolades with open arms and offer an equal amount of affection in return.
 ----- 
 If you find that there's tension in a close relationship, you may get the feeling that this isn't the right partner for you, Cancer. Don't automatically assume that the problem lies in your partner. Difficult situations involving the need for love and affection are likely to emerge regardless of the situation or the company. Instead of running to the next person, take the time to work things out.
 ----- 
 When tension builds, your sense of security is likely to falter, Leo. You may have a hard time dealing with other people. You could be tempted to turn to food or alcohol for inner nourishment. Curing emotional needs by indulging this way may temper your ailment for a while, but it isn't the solution to the overall problem. Work out the bugs with the people involved, and don't try to do it on an empty stomach.
 ----- 
 You might have difficulty expressing your needs, Virgo. The bottom line is that there's no right or wrong way, although it may be difficult to see this on a day like today. Deep
 ----- 
 Although you may find it hard to express yourself in some ways, Libra, the one avenue that's completely wide open today is art. Difficult tension is laced with emotional insecurity, making it hard for you to express your feelings. If you feel that this is the case, find some other means of expressing these emotions. A large canvas and some paints will work quite nicely.
 ----- 
 You might be feeling rather insecure when it comes to your peace of mind, Scorpio. Because of the insecurity, it may seem like your relationships are on the rocks. At the same time, having problems in your relationships is making you less likely to trust these close partners with your insecure feelings. Talking about your emotions in an honest manner will help you break out of this difficult situation.
 ----- 
 You may feel more reserved than usual, Sagittarius, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. You may be feeling apprehensive about expressing yourself fully, even in the most intimate situations. Be careful about sending messages that suggest that you don't want to be around others. People are apt to think they're to blame for your reluctance. It's fine to be a recluse, but don't completely alienate yourself in the process.
 ----- 
 Be careful about being too boisterous and chipper around people who don't exactly feel the same way, Capricorn. Be sensitive to other people's feelings, and don't make jokes that are too harsh for the occasion. No one appreciates a wise guy. There's a somber mood to the day that's likely to form a dark cloud by late afternoon. Do your best to be the ray of sunshine and not the bolt of lightning.
 ----- 
 Your mood should be quite good for the most part, Aquarius, but there's apt to be some tension in your relationships. Romantic endeavors aren't exactly in your favor now, so don't force an issue that seems too difficult to resolve. Find comfort in your internal warmth. By taking the time to nurture yourself, you will inevitably have more love to give to the people around you.
 ----- 
 There's a deep longing to be comforted and reassured, Pisces. You may want nothing more than for someone fix you some warm, homemade soup. If this is the case, feel free to call and ask a good friend to come over, if possible. Don't continue to play the part of the strong, independent one if this isn't the way you feel. If you aren't honest about your needs, it will be impossible for anyone to know how to fulfill them.
 ----- 
 You're likely now on the brink of completing a major move of some sort. Your first reaction may be to sit in solitary deliberation as you wrestle with the pros and cons of each piece of the situation. Try not to overload your head with too many details. Look at the overall picture. Perhaps you will find the answer you seek on a walk. During that time, you can clear your head of unnecessary clutter.
 ----- 
 This is one of those days when you will be walking along and all of a sudden hear a street performer playing music. Suddenly your feet start to move and soon you're dancing. You find yourself boogying down the rest of the road. It won't take much to get you grooving. Once you start, it may be hard for you to stop. Go with it!
 ----- 
 Don't take things that don't belong to you, Gemini. Your penetrating eyes are apt to spot things that are easily pocketed, even though you know deep down that those things aren't meant for you to keep. Your imagination might try to convince you that it's OK to pull such sneaky maneuvers, and you may be tempted. Don't deceive yourself.
 ----- 
 Try not to think too much about what is "supposed" to happen next, Cancer. The truth of the matter is that things don't necessarily work out the way they're planned, so don't count on something that has no guarantee of coming to fruition. Stick to your own way of doing things and try not to get too hung up on the results. The key now is to enjoy the process.
 ----- 
 Water your plants today and make sure they're getting enough light, Leo. If you don't have any plants, take this opportunity to go to the nursery and pick up a couple for your home or office. Nourish the organic things in your life to help remind you of your own roots, which are extremely important for you right now. Sink deep into the Earth in order to understand the environment around you.
 ----- 
 You're on a roll today, Virgo. Don't let other people's insecurities or shallow understanding about an issue get in the way of your progress. There's a distinct advantage to the way you approach things. Feel free to exert your will on those who need strong direction. If you're confident about the answer, don't be shy about saying so. If people don't like the way you're leading, they don't need to follow.
 ----- 
 You may be wondering whose shoulder you should cry on, Libra. Usually yours is the shoulder that everyone else likes to use. The collar of your shirt is probably soaking wet by now, thanks to all the tears that have spilled on you. Your compassion for others is definitely one of your biggest strengths but be aware of the fact that it can also be one of your biggest weaknesses.
 ----- 
 Your coals have been smoldering for a while, and there is a great deal of smoke pouring from your blackened embers, Scorpio. The good news is that there's apt to be a great gust of wind today, acting as the catalyst that ignites the flames. You've provided the heat and the fuel. The missing element of air is finally coming your way, so be prepared. The fire is apt to heat up quickly.
 ----- 
 Be wary of big promises today, Sagittarius. This could be one of those days when people are more likely to take a gamble because they're unrealistic about how things are going to work out. Don't be surprised if the stock market jumps as a result of the dollar signs that people imagine. It will be hard for others to resist when people receive promises of a big payoff.
 ----- 
 Feel free to go shopping online for yourself, Capricorn. While you're at it, you might as well pick out some things for others, too. You're apt to be in tune with the pleasant spirit of the people around you. On the other hand, if they're being especially negative or cranky, don't hesitate to just go elsewhere. Unfortunately, that may be easier said than done.
 ----- 
 You're likely to gravitate toward those who can put on a show and carry your imagination to a far
 ----- 
 Connect with those who carry you upward and encourage your fantasies today instead of those who try to bring you down to reality, Pisces. There's a need for you to shine more brightly than usual, and there's no reason why this wish shouldn't be granted. Everything will work out splendidly for you as long as you align yourself with admirable people and noble causes, so go for it.
 ----- 
 This is a fantastic time for you for love and romance, Aries, even if there's a bit of coolness between you and the person you care about. It's possible that there needs to be an element of distance now for you to really appreciate the good thing you have. If you aren't involved with someone now, you should find that you're in a good position to make a move toward someone you feel strongly about.
 ----- 
 It's one thing to be a friend and it's another to feed someone's ego just to make him or her happy, Taurus. Make sure that you aren't telling someone lies just because you know that that is what he or she wants to hear. A true friend is someone who is honest at all times, even if it means that you may temporarily hurt that person's feelings.
 ----- 
 It's critical that you not try to gain the love and appreciation of another by controlling their decisions, Gemini. It's time to let the people around you set their own rules and boundaries. Give that special person space to decide what's best, then you can take action accordingly. It may be that you discover things about this person that you probably would never have known if you called all the shots.
 ----- 
 You might need to put on the brakes today when it comes to love and romance, Cancer. Don't think that this means you have to break off any sort relationship that's in the works but realize that you may need to take a more realistic approach to how you handle it. The problem is that you may be getting so caught up in the fantasy of things that you aren't tending to practicalities.
 ----- 
 Things should be going quite well for you today, Leo, and you will find that aspects of your life that may have felt disconnected in the past are finally slipping into place. Have faith that all your painstaking planning and organizing is finally going to pay off. This is especially true in love and romance. Spend intimate time with a close partner tonight if possible.
 ----- 
 Restriction and discipline might not be your forte, Virgo, but realize that this may be exactly the type of thing that you need the most. Try not to expend your energy in too many directions. Focus and channel your efforts into the things you consider the most important. Make sure that most of your day is spent tending to these things. Have you hugged your loved ones lately?
 ----- 
 Appreciate the good things you have today, Libra. Don't let another day go by without really paying homage to the people who've helped you grow along the way. Take a walk. Climb a tree or help a child build a tree house. Connect with your spiritual side that finds satisfaction in where you are now instead of always feeling a need to search for something bigger and better.
 ----- 
 When it comes to matters of love and romance, you may need to tone things down a bit, Scorpio. An aggressive approach now may drive your loved one further away from you instead of drawing him or her closer. Remember that love is a two
 ----- 
 You may find that your love is incredibly magnetic now, Sagittarius. All you need to do is be yourself and suddenly people flock your way. There are terrific opportunities for you to strengthen the bonds you have with the people you care about the most. Solidify your relationship with soft romantic words and actions. There is an extra sensuality to your mood and actions now.
 ----- 
 Consider taking a more conservative approach to your actions today, Capricorn, as well as to the way you dress. Others may be rather put off by something that comes across as too flashy. Fashion is apt to be a significant concern for you now, which is fine. Don't underestimate the power of personal appearance.
 ----- 
 Romantic relationships may not exactly be going as well as you'd like, Aquarius, but don't get discouraged. Hang in there and you will find that things eventually come around your way. You may need to strengthen your internal sense of confidence, since it's doubtful that you will get much support from interactions with the people around you.
 ----- 
 It could be that you're trying to communicate with someone in a matter regarding love and romance and it simply isn't working. You're apt to feel like you need a translator in order to get your message across. Both you and your partner need to share responsibility for making sure that the lines of communication remain open. Be practical yet sensitive in your approach.
 ----- 
 Be aware that love is likely to wear some sort of disguise today, Aries. There's something fanciful about the way in which this new romance will manifest, so get ready. Don't think that love always has to be planned and calculated. There is a strong sense of spontaneity associated with the delicious love interest of the day. Don't dismiss those who don't seem practical or levelheaded enough for you.
 ----- 
 Make your loved one a romantic dinner tonight, Taurus. Escort him or her on an imaginary magic
 ----- 
 When it comes to romantic relationships, Gemini, you might find that you're playing more of a game of hide
 ----- 
 You're apt to be somewhat fickle when it comes to love and romance right now, Cancer. The key for you now is freedom. The problem with this mindset is that it might be misinterpreted. Your partner may think you simply aren't interested in him or her anymore. Remind your partner that it's OK to love someone while also needing time and space to do things on your own.
 ----- 
 You may be confused when it comes to matters of the heart, Leo. Perhaps you feel cheated when the object of your desire doesn't give you complete attention at all times. The fundamental security of your being is your responsibility, not someone else's. Find a way to incorporate your dreams into the dreams of others instead of always working toward goals at opposite sides of the spectrum.
 ----- 
 Your fairytale imagination of how your romantic life should run is hooking you up with many different opportunities, Virgo. Whether you realize it or not, the optimal situation you seek is within your grasp. Make sure that you aren't trying to manipulate a certain person into becoming the person you want him or her to be. If you're unhappy in your relationship, perhaps you need to find someone new.
 ----- 
 Your dreams work out quite nicely in your head, Libra, but the problem now is how to turn them into some sort of real
 ----- 
 Love and personal relationships are likely to take on a much dreamier and more romantic tone now, Scorpio. Your eyes are apt to sparkle as you speak or even think of the person you care about the most. The unmistakable glow that surrounds you is likely to attract others to your side even if you aren't in the market for a romantic relationship right now.
 ----- 
 When it comes to relationships with others, be careful about insisting that everything be done only your way, Sagittarius. It could be that you have such high expectations of your partner that he or she will never be able to live up to your standards. Basically, you're setting the stage for failure by demanding that the person for you be of a certain make and model.
 ----- 
 Your fantasies could come true now, especially when it comes to relationships, Capricorn. This could be the moment you've always dreamed about, so get ready. The attractive, romantic person in the corner has been keeping an eye on you all night. Your blood is pumping faster than ever. Remind yourself that all dreams can come true on a day such as today.
 ----- 
 While you normally like all of your romantic relationships to be extremely nurturing and comforting, you may find that this isn't always possible, Aquarius. There's a disconnect between you and a close partner right now that could be hard to rectify. Time is really the only thing that's likely to resolve this sort of problem. Remember that all of your relationships can't always go exactly according to plan.
 ----- 
 A creative project that you've been working on may be coming to a climactic peak now, Pisces. Discuss your progress with others and feel free to hold an informal critique in order to get honest feedback on your work. A piece of art should stir some sort of reaction inside another person. Consider ways in which you can challenge the people around you with your talent.
 ----- 
 An unexpected package could arrive, possibly shipped from far away. The circumstances could be rather strange. Friends or relatives that you might not expect could suddenly call or text, and you could an hour or more catching up. This can be very gratifying, Aries, but don't wear yourself out. Youll have a good time no matter what you talk about.
 ----- 
 Today you might strategize ways to make a little extra money to prepare to move ahead with your life and ambitions. This might be in conjunction with your significant other or some close friends. Browsing online shops might result in impulse purchases, as gifts or perhaps for yourself. In the evening, plan some time alone with your partner or go on your favorite dating app and look for one if you're single.
 ----- 
 Your naturally passionate nature should be more aroused than usual today. The festive atmosphere around you gives rise to warm, intimate feelings that bring friends and couples closer together, Gemini, so prepare for some good times and excitement in the home tonight, if possible. Optimism and enthusiasm should fill the air. You will feel secure and comfortable yet crackling with ardor. Go for it!
 ----- 
 An intense card, email, or phone call could come from a sibling or other relative today. Perhaps this is a good chance to patch up an old quarrel with this person, but don't be tempted to start another! Emotions are running high now, Cancer, and it wouldn't take much to set someone off. You might want to go out and do a little shopping but be careful. Traffic could be bad.
 ----- 
 Contact with a friend's may have to be delayed, and this might worry you. It will be necessary to make a special effort to get almost anything done today, Leo. You could have some urgent chores to complete, but the streets and stores may be full of impatient people. Relax, breathe deeply, and summon every bit of energy you have. You don't want to put anything off now.
 ----- 
 A love relationship could take on a higher and more spiritual aspect during this period, creating a desire for your souls to bond. The planetary atmosphere brings you closer together, and you may experience a closer sense of intimacy. You two might spend time with mutual friends today, if possible, enjoying yourselves, but at the same time anxious to be alone. Bask in the glow.
 ----- 
 The planetary energy might find you responding to a sudden sense of inspiration that arouses your creativity. You may feel an unexpected urge to write, paint, draw, or compose some music. You may want to sequester yourself, which could cause some problems with friends and family members who want to be on close contact with you. Don't ignore this impetus, Libra. As you know, inspiration can vanish as quickly as it comes.
 ----- 
 You've been very busy, professionally and socially, and now you're probably longing for a romantic encounter. If you're currently involved, you should schedule some time alone with the special person in your life. If you aren't involved, don't be surprised if someone new appears on the scene. You could fall in love at first sight or an old friend could suddenly look different to you. Make sure you look your best!
 ----- 
 You're likely to want to spend some time alone with your partner today, Sagittarius, but with the current planetary influences at play, either you or your honey's career concerns could get in the way. An unexpected opportunity needs to be explored right away, so you might not be able to spend any time together now. Contact with friends could also prove frustrating since everyone is busy.
 ----- 
 A co
 ----- 
 Warm and sensitive by nature, Aquarius, today you could feel especially sensual. Sex and romance are likely to be on your mind. Romantic novels and movies may seem especially appealing now, as could cozy beds and warm baths. Plan a romantic evening with the special person in your life, if possible. Perhaps a special candlelit dinner at home.
 ----- 
 A minor accident might take place at home today, Pisces, but don't worry. It will ultimately provoke more laughter than harm. You will want the place to look great, Pisces, because a close friend or lover could come to visit. An intimate conversation or passionate encounter is indicated. Curb the temptation to indulge in too much food or drink.
 ----- 
 Get on the fast track and use your powerful words and creative mind to make quick decisions that are mindful yet spontaneous. If you get in a pinch today, Aries, don't worry about it. Simply relax, take a deep breath, and let your intuition guide you to the right path. Instead of wasting your energy thrashing helplessly in the water, call for help.
 ----- 
 Start the day with some vigorous yoga and then some meditation to help clear your mind, Taurus. Stretch your body and get the blood flowing through all of your limbs. Once your blood is flowing, your mind will get moving. Before it gets too far into its noisy routine, take the opportunity to maintain a quiet, serene state while you clear out the static and set forth your goals for the day.
 ----- 
 Do something for the community today, Gemini, and really consider how your talents and skills can best be put to work. Consider volunteering at a school or library. Donate blood or help the elderly. Whatever you do, smile knowing that you're making direct contact with friends who need your assistance. Instead of just complaining about the way things are going, take a proactive role in leading the way toward a more philanthropic world.
 ----- 
 If you're having trouble tackling a giant problem, Cancer, don't get discouraged or overwhelmed. They key for you is to break things down into smaller chunks, analyze them, and figure out their role within the greater whole. You will find that by taking things one step at a time, any problem you encounter will be infinitely easier to overcome than you may have thought at first.
 ----- 
 It may seem like everyone around you is happy and getting what they want while you're stuck in the trenches, Leo. Don't compare yourself to other people and make judgments based on outside appearances. The truth of the matter is that they're most likely only looking at the immediate future and experiencing short
 ----- 
 Imagination and fantasy play a big part in your thinking today, Virgo, and you shouldn't hesitate to embrace this frame of mind. There's a great deal of power to be drawn from your sense of freedom to explore and dream. Your thinking is more of a higher consciousness now. You should take advantage of this lofty perspective to see things from a neutral viewpoint.
 ----- 
 Engage more of your rational mind today, Libra. If your mind continues on its track into a fantasy world, you might consider enlisting the help of people who can help you bring some discipline to your situation. For you, the general feeling of the day is likely to be that the mind is willing, but the flesh is weak. Let others help you get inspired to get out of lazy mode.
 ----- 
 Suppose you were someone else for a day, Scorpio. How would it feel to be treated the way you normally treat other people? This is a good time to put yourself in someone else's shoes and experience life through their eyes. By doing this, you're apt to become more conscious of your own actions and the effect of those actions on the people around you.
 ----- 
 Today your thoughts may turn to fashion and the different ways in which you can improve your wardrobe. Don't be afraid to create a look that reflects your true inner spirit. Deck yourself in external splendor to illustrate the many different colors and layers that you carry on the inside. Don't hesitate to pick up a fashion magazine at the grocery store.
 ----- 
 The amazing thing about your nature is that, like a good politician, you have just the right tone of voice and catch phrase for every situation. You can put on your smile and charm and talk your way out of just about any pickle you get into. Embrace this incredible gift, but make sure that your overall goals are noble as opposed to self
 ----- 
 You're apt to get the feeling that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence today, Aquarius. Try not to get too hung up on this. Either make the effort to go where the landscape looks richer and more fruitful or stay where you are. The key to true happiness is to make sure that regardless of where you end up, you enjoy the spot where you are.
 ----- 
 Your mind may wander to a fantasyland full of castles, wizards, and magic dragons today, Pisces. You could find that you're putting yourself in the robes of a beautiful or handsome figure in a tall tower who's waiting for the perfect mate to come along. Observe the fanciful scenario you've created and see how the symbols and characters connect with your real life. Your imagination is trying to tell you something.
 ----- 
 Don't get so stuck in your ways today that you insist on having the one true answer without really considering the options. You must be aware of a lot before you commit yourself one way or another. The people around you are apt to get annoyed with your narrow
 ----- 
 Quietly step into the background if things aren't going the way you'd like, Taurus. Don't try to stick your nose into someone else's business, even if you think you know the right way to proceed. People probably have strong opinions, and they won't be swayed in any direction. The best you can do is take care of yourself. You will probably find that this means you shouldn't be seen or heard.
 ----- 
 You may have gotten yourself tangled up in a deep mental drama over a series of recent incidents, Gemini. Your mind may be working overtime in order to solve the riddles. It's quite possible that the reality of the situation is that you're simply making a big deal over nothing. Today is one of those days in which you will face the harsh reality that comes as a consequence of your over
 ----- 
 You may feel as if your smile is unwelcome today, Cancer. It may seem to you like there's some sort of gloom and doom to people's attitudes that makes them unwilling to accept any sort of good news. Don't let this stop you from maintaining your own cheerful state. It's important that you not probe too deeply into the reasons behind other people's behavior now.
 ----- 
 Keep careful track of things today, Leo, for you will find that the smallest detail will make the biggest difference. Don't hesitate to go with your hunches when something simply doesn't sound right. Stay focused and try not to get caught off guard when emotional issues come out of nowhere and disturb your thoughts. Trust yourself regardless of what's going on around you.
 ----- 
 You may feel as if your hands are tied today and you're faced with absolutely no options, Virgo. Don't despair over a situation that seems insurmountable. Think of yourself as a terrific magician who can burst out of the strongest chains. You have tricks up your sleeve that can help you escape just about any situation in which you find yourself.
 ----- 
 This is a good time to take a stand on an issue that you may have been vacillating about lately, Libra. People will lose confidence in you if you can't seem to make up your mind. What they don't realize is that you've been working overtime to process all the information. Now it's time to express orally what you've discovered mentally.
 ----- 
 Today is one of those days in which you will be bursting at the seams to share big news with your friends, Scorpio. Perhaps you just received an important package or piece of information and you can't wait to spread the news. Be careful about who might be lurking around, however, because there could be others listening in. They may not necessarily be acting in your best interests.
 ----- 
 Your reluctance to speak could get you in trouble today, Sagittarius. You may hesitate to share what you know for fear of what others might think. You should realize that you're using this as an excuse to hide what's really just selfishness. Share your knowledge with others and you will be amazed at the knowledge that comes back to you in return. Keep in mind that you may need to wait for it.
 ----- 
 There may be a great tension between you and someone older today, Capricorn. Perhaps there's someone who's adopting a sort of "parent knows best" personality that's starting to annoy you. Take a breather. Realize that this person isn't being critical or judgmental but just giving you advice. You should open your eyes and understand that this advice could be very useful.
 ----- 
 There's apt to be a comfortable feeling about today that should make you feel quite secure and nurtured, Aquarius. Perhaps you're feeling protected by a strong force, maybe an internal one, that's reminding you that as long as you stay within the lines, everything will be fine. There's a familiarity to things that will make it easy for you to navigate any rough waters.
 ----- 
 You could feel like a rat in a maze today, Pisces. Walls and long, narrow corridors take you around corners and through doorways, yet there's no indication that you're going in the right direction. Instead of wandering aimlessly, stop and ask for help. You might not have noticed that if you look up, there are knowledgeable beings there who are willing to give you advice based on their lofty perspective.
 ----- 
 Add spark to your life today, Aries. It could be that things are getting stale and boring. If so, consider the possibility that you simply aren't challenging yourself enough. Remember that you're responsible for lighting your own fire. You have the perfect opportunity to get something started today, so go for it. Feel free to get other people to help.
 ----- 
 People are apt to try to hit you square on the head with their ideas and thoughts today, Taurus, so be ready for the onslaught of information that may come your way. There's a distinct advantage to listening to the whole spiel before you react with your own facts and emotions. The problem is that you're going to be tempted to argue instead of calmly resolve the matter.
 ----- 
 Anchor yourself in practical matters before you try to prove your point to others. There's a great deal of primal energy rising within you today and searching for some sort of outlet. Be aware of overextending yourself when it comes to issues of the mind. You may be so anxious to prove your point that you end up losing sight of the reality of the situation.
 ----- 
 Don't take no for an answer today, Cancer. Know what you believe in and stick with it. There's a distinct advantage to holding true to your inner nature. Don't let others throw you off course with their views on how things should be done. Be confident and don't worry about taking things over the top. There's no such thing as excess today. "The more the merrier" should be your motto.
 ----- 
 Be a pioneer thinker today, Leo. There's a noble courage in your thoughts, so don't let this quality go to waste. You will be surprised at how cutting edge you can be when you put your mind to it. Take a walk by yourself and contemplate the next major move that you'd like to make in your life. Feel free to brainstorm bold ways to execute this plan.
 ----- 
 Be aggressive and forceful when it comes to exerting your will, Virgo. Let others know that you won't be a pushover. Your opinions are extremely important, and they need to be heard by the people who matter the most. Have faith that whatever you say has the power to come true, especially when you enlist the help of those around you. Opportunity lies in joining hands with others.
 ----- 
 Today may be one of those days in which you come to a four
 ----- 
 People would be foolish to challenge your thinking now, Scorpio. The power behind your words is volatile, and you may find yourself going to extremes in order to get your point across. Be careful about making promises you can't fulfill. It could be that you're so adamant about your point of view that you make up hyperbolic situations just to get your ideas across.
 ----- 
 Your old ways of thinking have carried you quite far, Sagittarius, but you may now find that it's time to seek a new platform for your ideas. Look for more adventurous ways to express yourself. Break out of the old mold and try something new. Once you start in a bran
 ----- 
 One quick phone call to a friend may turn into a long discussion about the meaning of life, Capricorn. Be conscious of the fact that there's a great deal of momentum building in your mind now. Once the dam breaks, you may soon have a giant flood on your hands. Be careful about releasing all this energy at once, even though you may not seem to have a choice.
 ----- 
 It could be that you feel a bit of pressure today to start or create something that you aren't quite ready for, Aquarius. There is hesitation on your part that indicates you should take it slowly and learn more of the facts before you jump into the fray. Position yourself in such a way that you take control of the situation rather than become a victim of it.
 ----- 
 Move forward with your plan of attack today, Pisces. There's an anxious rumble within you that's urging you to get going with a current plan. You have all the facts you need, so don't hesitate any longer. The power of the word is with you. You will be smooth, collected, and confident even in the most nerve
 ----- 
 Exciting news could come to you today that could bring a lot of joy into your life, Aries. Your income may soon skyrocket, and more opportunities to advance yourself professionally should start coming thick and fast. You may even receive some sort of public acknowledgment. This isn't the end of the line, however 
 ----- 
 A powerful bond between you and a romantic partner could have you walking around with your head in the clouds, Taurus. Things between you seem to be improving by leaps and bounds. Right now, it all seems just too perfect. Savor every moment of your time together. You will want to remember them when times aren't quite so easy. We all deserve such halcyon days. You and your beloved should definitely make the most of it.
 ----- 
 Gemini, love of all kinds 
 ----- 
 A small gathering of friends, relatives, and neighbors could take place in your neighborhood today, if possible, Cancer. You might run into a few old friends you haven't seen in a long time and enjoy catching up. A former romantic partner could also get in contact. Are you still interested? If so, pursue it. It might work this time! If you're no longer interested, perhaps you could now be friends. Think about it!
 ----- 
 If you've asked your employer for a raise recently, Leo, the astral energy indicates that you can expect to receive one soon. Your employer is greatly impressed with your efforts, and probably thinking that you might be setting your sights elsewhere. Opportunities may certainly appear, although this is obviously not the time to decide. Take some time to really think and consider everything carefully.
 ----- 
 An unexpected letter or package might arrive sometime today, Virgo. This could be a gift from a lover 
 ----- 
 Happiness reigns in the home right now, Libra. Money comes pouring in from bonuses, salary from extra hours, or gifts. You may be considering spending some of this money on either adding to or refurbishing your home. If you're having trouble making a decision, consider consulting a decorator. There is great harmony within your family. You seem to understand each other on an intuitive level.
 ----- 
 Are you single, Scorpio? If so, today you might fall in love at first sight. You may have been frustrated lately by the lack of available, interesting people, but today you could meet someone who seems too perfect for words. And you can rest assured that the attraction is mutual! If you're already involved, you can expect a revival of the fairytale romance between you and a significant other.
 ----- 
 A strong attraction to someone could take you by surprise today, Sagittarius. This person could be involved in the arts in some way, perhaps film, television, or recording. You might spend considerable time, perhaps virtually, together for the purpose of working on a project, but the energy between you should be strong and apparent to both of you. If you're interested in a new relationship, make sure you look your best!
 ----- 
 Are you involved in a creative project that involves modern technology, Capricorn? If so, progress could be made by leaps and bounds, starting today. A lucky break might set you off in a new direction that adds depth and dimension to your work. Communication with colleagues should be warm, congenial, and supportive. There is a sense of unity that pervades the group and adds to the energy and enthusiasm. You will love the results of your efforts.
 ----- 
 If you own your home or have any kind of investments in real estate, Aquarius, you might hear some great news today about the value of that investment. It's likely to be increasing, and probably will continue in that direction. This could make a big difference in your life in some way right now. In fact, there might be a number of options opening to you. Consider them all carefully and go for the gold.
 ----- 
 Are you technically single but very deeply involved with someone, Pisces? If so, don't be surprised if today you extend or receive a proposal of marriage. Recent events have brought you very close together and greatly intensified the bond between you. Your partner may want to legalize that bond. Do you? If there is even the smallest doubt, give yourself some time to think. Acting on impulse isn't a good idea right now.
 ----- 
 You may discover an untapped talent today, Aries. Perhaps there's a new machine in the office and you're the only one who can figure out how to use it. Maybe drafting a simple business proposal makes you realize how much you enjoy the writing process. This is a good day for any kind of creative endeavor, as well as for paperwork of all sorts. Get everything done so you can enjoy the evening.
 ----- 
 Expect some positive developments today that impact the whole family, Taurus. Perhaps you or your mate will receive word of a significant raise or great job opportunity. Perhaps you meet the one who is right for you, and you know it the instant you lock eyes. Whichever it is, don't let the opportunity pass. If you don't seize it, someone else surely will.
 ----- 
 You should be feeling especially confident today, Gemini. You've been working especially hard lately, and the recognition you've received goes a long way toward reinforcing your feelings of self
 ----- 
 This is a day made for fun and frivolity, Cancer, not one in which you're likely to get many of your chores done. Try as you might to focus on the task at hand, there are distractions everywhere you turn. Your email pals could be sending you jokes and notes, and your friends could be bugging you to join them for whatever type of outing is possible now. You may as well give in.
 ----- 
 You're a person of many talents, and today you're likely to discover yet another one, Leo. The delivery of a new piece of equipment makes you feel like you've been given a toy for your sole enjoyment. But once you get the computer or piece of machinery up and running, you need to share it with your co
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if a lot of people contact you today, each one anxious to confer with you. It seems that you're the authority on all topics, Virgo. All the attention is flattering, but it makes it difficult to get any work done. Do what you can to help your co
 ----- 
 Don't let yourself be manipulated by needy friends, Libra. With today's planetary energies, it's a good time to think about setting clear boundaries. You know which friends are there for you and lift you up and which ones tend to drain all your time and energy with the constant need for your immediate attention. Try saying no. You can't fix other people's lives for them anyway. Think about it.
 ----- 
 This is a good day for sharing friendship with pals and co
 ----- 
 Your technical skills take a real leap forward today, Sagittarius. It seems all that training you've done is finally paying off. Your new skills will greatly increase your efficiency and enhance your marketability. If you've been thinking about applying for a new position, get your resume ready to send out when you see an appealing ad. Any move you make will be for the better.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised to see your co
 ----- 
 Life's been a real whirlwind lately, Aquarius. You may feel a bit overwhelmed by everything thats been going on. It's fun to catch up with everyone, but a bit daunting to renew ties with old friends and try to remember things that are going on with new ones. Take a deep breath, Aquarius, you're doing just fine.
 ----- 
 With all the conversations you've had lately, Pisces, it's likely that you've talked with some people in the healing professions. These doctors, nurses, and technicians could be useful to you later. Be sure to file their contact information away for future reference. On another front, expect to receive some good news concerning your finances.
 ----- 
 This is a good day to reflect on the past weeks and get some perspective, Aries. You've probably been working too hard and neglecting other priorities in your life. Give yourself this day to relax and talk with friends and relatives. Spend the day chatting, laughing, and unwinding. Don't obsess about tasks that wait for you at the office. They aren't going anywhere.
 ----- 
 Don't plunge headfirst into work mode, Taurus. The cleaning and tidying up can surely wait for another day. Today's energies indicate that talking with friends and family should be your main priority. Consider spending the afternoon doing activities with your kids. Hire a babysitter for the evening. It would do you good to go out with your partner 
 ----- 
 It's likely that your thoughts are completely turned to work. Much as you should devote your time off to family, you can't help the way you're wired, Gemini. When at home, you may sneak away to check your email. Perhaps you secretly phone your business partner. Your family rolls their eyes, but generally understands and forgives your crazy behavior. Be sure to turn on the extra charm, just in case!
 ----- 
 This is a good day for financial matters, Cancer. With your credit cards maxed out, you may be thinking that your bank account isn't as healthy as it could be. But today you're likely to receive some news that indicates otherwise. You may get a windfall or discover that your portfolio is generating healthy returns. It's a good day for paperwork.
 ----- 
 You could be feeling quite lazy today, Leo, and you definitely deserve to feel this way! You deserve some time off after all of the activities of the past week. Give yourself the gift of a true day off. Do only what you want, whether it's watching movies or spending the afternoon soaking in the tub. Total indulgence. Just relax and unwind.
 ----- 
 You think of yourself as a practical person, Virgo, but today your thoughts may turn to the mystical and spiritual. Your intuition is strong now, letting you tune in to the feelings of your loved ones. This allows you to be empathetic and understanding, which your partner especially appreciates. Your intuition may inspire you to approach a problem in a new way. Let your mind wander and see what develops.
 ----- 
 You will probably encounter a bit of opposition along with today's planetary energies, Libra. Even those who are usually right behind you will seem uncooperative. Try not to let this faze you too much. Resolve to follow your own instincts and work alone if need be. Once you've had a chance to advance your ideas further along on your own, you can present them again.
 ----- 
 Your thoughts today are likely to turn to setting goals for the future, particularly concerning your career. While you've made a lot of progress in recent months, you'd like to see even more forward movement. This would be a great day to start thinking of concrete ways to make that happen, Scorpio. Why not have a family brainstorming session? It's likely to yield some great advice.
 ----- 
 Today's planetary energies are stimulating your ambition, Sagittarius. Issues connected with your professional life may be very much on your mind. You could plot out ways to further your career. Perhaps you seek a promotion in your current business, or you could be thinking about looking for another job entirely. This is the ideal time to put specific plans into place for the future.
 ----- 
 You've been so busy these past few weeks that you may have inadvertently neglected the special person in your life, Capricorn. It's been fun to be out and about together, but that has left little time for closeness and snuggling. Try to rectify that today. In fact, a midafternoon nap might be called for. Why not invite your honey to join you?
 ----- 
 It's possible that a big change is in store for you in the near future, Aquarius. It may be that you've come to realize that your current home and neighborhood are no longer a good fit. If you've been toying with the idea of moving, today you may get some news that motivates you to make your fantasy a reality. This is a good day to peruse the real estate listings. You might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.
 ----- 
 Perhaps you spent quite a bit of money lately and you're holding your breath waiting for the bills to roll in. Some quick reckoning of receipts today likely yields some wonderful news. Wonder of wonders, it appears you've stayed within your budget, Pisces! Try not to overreact to the news that you have more money than you thought. Give your wallet and checkbook some time off.
 ----- 
 A lot of creative work may need to be finished by today, Aries. If you're professionally involved with writing, a deadline may loom. It could be difficult to get it done because family members and friends could constantly call and text, which keeps you from concentrating. The best course of action might be to go somewhere quiet, like a library, and do your work there. Think about it!
 ----- 
 What's happening in your community today that attracts crowds, Taurus? A parade? A festival of some kind? Some friends may want you to go with them, but you hesitate for many different reasons. Go if you want to but take necessary precautions. You could meet some interesting people. If you dont go, find another way to have fun. You deserve it.
 ----- 
 You may be too free with your money right now, Gemini. You're usually careful with it, but the spirit of generosity and abundance is definitely upon you. You're more inclined to be generous with those you care about. After all is said and done, you could panic, but don't. You're good at making money. A little belt tightening later is entirely possible, and it won't hurt you. Follow your heart 
 ----- 
 You usually love to talk, Cancer, but right now you've probably reached your limit. You've attended a number of virtual gatherings and talked to a lot of people over the past week or so, and now you want to sit quietly at home. If friends or family members insist on your chatting with them, don't be afraid to say no. Everyone knows how busy you've been. Take some time to yourself and relax.
 ----- 
 Have you been indulging in too many goodies, Leo? You might feel under the weather because of all this abundance. You probably should take it easy. Think about reorganizing your priorities. Is a second piece of chocolate cake more important than your energy and health? Indulging can be important to your psyche, but don't forget about moderation 
 ----- 
 It has been said that you can never have too many friends, Virgo, but today you might wonder if perhaps you do. Your phone could be ringing off the hook. One person after another will be soliciting you for advice and your famous shoulder to cry on. Be patient. One day you may need that person to be there for you. Try to listen and keep your sense of humor about you.
 ----- 
 A small gathering of some kind could attract you and your family tonight, Libra. Perhaps you will arrange to meet some friends there, if possible. You may feel good just being out with those you love, but you're likely to be tired by the end of the event. Make sure you fortify yourself with nourishing food during the day. Take care of yourself so you can have some fun.
 ----- 
 Too many phone calls may be on the agenda today, Scorpio. You might also have a few last
 ----- 
 You may have lost your usual control of the purse strings and spent too much money lately, Sagittarius. Don't worry about it. It's all been for a good cause. It's nothing you can't handle, and certainly not enough to bankrupt you. The situation is only temporary anyway. The financial picture looks great for you in the months to come. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Generally, you're a very sociable person, Capricorn, and today you wont want to slow down. Invitations to parties, from intimate coffee klatches to big neighborhood bashes, continue to come in, but you weigh the pros and cons of attending carefully now. Saying no goes against your nature because you don't want to miss anything. But right now, you must pick the most important to you and leave the rest.
 ----- 
 You and other members of your household might suddenly decide to do one more thorough house cleaning, Aquarius. Usually this would be a good idea, but today it doesn't really need it, and you might work too hard and do too much. Do you really need to clean your closets now? Dust and vacuum, then spruce it up with some decorations, and that should be enough for now. Relax!
 ----- 
 Too many people may be making demands on your time right now, Pisces. Some may have genuine concerns and need your assistance, but others have definite agendas that they really should deal with on their own. Use your intuition to tell the difference because you won't be able to help them all. A female friend might have the most urgent need. If you can only help one, help her.
 ----- 
 A call form someone you havent heard from in a while could generate mixed feelings, Aries. On the one hand, you're probably glad to resume contact with this person. On the other, because you weren't expecting to hear from them, it could create extra emotions for you 
 ----- 
 Someone who's been ill and perhaps undergone surgery might phone you today, Taurus. You could invite this person to join you for a little virtual social gathering. Several people could be involved. All of them will have some interesting and useful information to offer. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 With the planetary atmosphere today, your sensual nature is in full bloom. If there's a romantic partner nearby, that person should be on guard! There may be a lot of other people around, so a chance to be alone probably won't present itself until this evening. If you don't connect with a potential partner, at least you'll have a good time. Hang in there and be patient!
 ----- 
 You might have to play nurse today, Cancer. A love partner could claim to feel unwell, and you might expend a lot of energy trying to make your friend feel better. Don't overdo it. There may be psychological factors at work. Your friend could be jealous of the attention you've been giving family and friends. Be attentive, but within limits!
 ----- 
 You're generally focused on the material world, Leo, but something about the energy generated by today's planetary alignments causes you to look within. You might think about the joys and pains of past family gatherings and wonder how they affect your life now. This is a positive, healing process, so don't fight it. It won't interfere with what's going on around you.
 ----- 
 A virtual group event could put you in contact with a number of people interested in doing a healing meditation for the planet. This sort of activity can work wonders to strengthen the bond among those performing it. You might not talk much during the discussions, but you're apt to be in total agreement with the idea. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Happiness reigns in the home as everyone feels the energy changing, Libra. It seems that the end of one cycle brings closure, and now you're free to start a new journey of rebirth. You, above all, are apt to feel a powerful rush of intuition, which could reveal positive events coming up for you and those close to you. A few doubts may cloud your impressions, but let them go.
 ----- 
 Are you going to go away soon, Scorpio? If not, you may be planning a trip for another month, perhaps going for educational purposes, such as to attend a workshop. You might have agreed to some overseas business travel. You should feel especially energetic, enthusiastic, and optimistic now. You've done well thanks to your diligent work, and you should continue on that path.
 ----- 
 Instinct and determination drive you toward unconventional plans for making money, Sagittarius. A finance counselor or other professional could be involved. You may see this as an opportunity to restore your ailing bank account. You may have future purchases in mind, perhaps even a new home. Consider your plans carefully before going ahead. You'll want to be sure it's what you need.
 ----- 
 Today you may feel a passionate attraction for someone intelligent who perhaps makes a living in law, education, or publishing, Capricorn. Conversations with this person could touch on some deep issues, such as spiritual matters, the human psyche, or the nature of the universe. You should be deeply affected, not only by the person but also by the subjects. Take a walk later to clear your head.
 ----- 
 This could be a quiet day for you and your partner, Aquarius. You could spend some time reflecting on past achievements and future goals. It's important to get a clear picture about the past so you can draw conclusions and make workable plans. If you have a family, you'll probably be interested in activities that everyone will enjoy. Make some time to get together when its possible. Leave tension behind.
 ----- 
 All the positive energy generated by the celestial atmosphere seems to come together today as you experience a rush of sensual passion for a romantic partner, Pisces. An unexpected encounter could not only fulfill this desire but also bring you closer. If you aren't already committed, expect to discuss it tonight. Be careful to exercise restraint. Your lover could panic if you push too hard.
 ----- 
 Have you been considering working more at home, Aries? If so, today you might decide to do just that. An opportunity could pave the way for new jobs you could do at home, in your own space, among your own belongings. This could add to your sense of security. The only downside could be if you don't make the effort, you might never leave the house. Be sure to get your workout in!
 ----- 
 A conversation with a sibling or neighbor could lead to you making a new friend today, Taurus, probably someone who works in a creative profession. If you're currently romantically involved, this person could become your best friend. If you're unattached, sparks could fly between you and him or her. You could talk for hours and part unwillingly. Exchange contact information. You'll be glad you did!
 ----- 
 Changes taking place at home could lead to more income, Gemini. Perhaps a new housemate moves in, reducing your housing costs. Or you might even consider moving to a new place, perhaps one that's closer to where family members live or work. Whatever it is, it may not seem like much, but it should make a difference in your financial situation in the long run. Go for it!
 ----- 
 A walk through your neighborhood could put you in the middle of an unexpected, interesting event, Cancer. It may be a small public gathering or an impromptu get
 ----- 
 Some books you've been reading lately might excite your desire to study astrology, numerology, alchemy, or some other occult science, Leo. This may not be something that you'd normally consider, but don't let that hold you back. Your values have been shaken up lately anyway, so make the most of the impulse now. It could transform you in a subtle way. Go for it!
 ----- 
 Boredom might stimulate your rebellious streak today, Virgo. You could decide to forego your usual tasks and do something unusual or unexpected, such as skydiving or horseback riding. Don't feel guilty if you decide to do this. We all need to throw caution to the wind and go for some excitement occasionally. Follow your instincts and have fun!
 ----- 
 A virtual class or lecture of some kind could bring you exciting new information today, Libra. This could keep your mind buzzing for hours, particularly since you may also communicate with some interesting people with whom you can discuss this subject for hours. Make the effort to take a walk and clear your head at some point during the day or else you might be too mentally charged up to sleep.
 ----- 
 A future journey may be in the works right now, Scorpio. Many changes have been occurring in your life for a long time, and they continue today. They might involve group events or educational activities. This may be something you've anticipated for a long time. Your energy, enthusiasm, and excitement are high. You may be too restless to sit still. Try to get some exercise at some point.
 ----- 
 A change in career could be in the works for you, Sagittarius. It might be within the scope of your current job or an entirely new one. It's definitely a change for the better. Don't let insecurity or an attachment to your current circumstances hold you back. Whatever opportunities appear at this time may not come around again for a long while. Think about it carefully and then follow your heart.
 ----- 
 An unexpected opportunity to go on a long journey, perhaps business
 ----- 
 Too much hard work and stress could be taking a physical toll on you today, Aquarius. But it isn't likely to stop you from working intently and energetically on a project that fascinates you. This enterprise could be personal or job related, but whatever it is, the turn it takes is apt to surprise you. It might not be anything like what you'd planned! Go to it!
 ----- 
 If you're single, Pisces, today you could fall in love at first sight. A friend could send you someones contact information who shares your interests and with whom you'll talk for hours. This could make you feel happy. You'll certainly enjoy your day. If you want to stay in touch, don't be afraid to say so. Otherwise, you might lose track of your new friend.
 ----- 
 The time is right for all things financial, Aries. If you've been thinking of signing a contract to accept a job or purchase a piece of property, go ahead. Strategize ways in which you can be even more financially successful in the future. You have a lot of skills, but you don't always apply them as carefully as you could. Correct this and you'll be unstoppable!
 ----- 
 Expect to get some useful financial information today, Taurus. You may learn about a new investment, or perhaps you'll get wind of a job opening that's right up your alley. This is a good day to consider an alternate life path. Although there's nothing wrong with the one you're on, it's always good to consider other roads.
 ----- 
 Expect your romantic relationship to be better than ever today, Gemini. You're communicating well and in touch with one another's feelings. How wonderful to be able to maintain an inspiring, rewarding bond with someone who loves you. There is much to be grateful for. This could be a good time to take your relationship to the next level. Your partner won't mind discussing this.
 ----- 
 This could be a banner day, Cancer. Your spiritual and career goals come together so both are enhanced, and neither is compromised. It's a neat trick. You can expect the opportunity to practice what you preach to come to you through a friend or colleague. Don't discount any ideas presented to you, as one will contain the key to meshing two of the most important parts of your life.
 ----- 
 Be your most charming self tonight, Leo. You're likely to talk with someone who can help your career. Your intuition is strong, so you may know who this person is the minute you begin your conversation. If the chemistry is good, too, so much the better! Whether this person impacts your life in a romantic or business capacity, you'll remember this night as when your life changed for the better!
 ----- 
 You have an introspective nature, Virgo. For the last few weeks, you've been reflecting on and assessing what does and doesn't work in your life. It's likely that you're ready for some kind of major change. Either your relationship is in a rut or you need a complete career overhaul. Follow your instincts as you plan how to develop and grow from here. You are your own best guide.
 ----- 
 You're ready for something new and different, Libra. What better time than during the current transits to put into practice what has only been a dream? You may decide to work for yourself or ditch one relationship in favor of another. You want the changes you implement to be brash and far
 ----- 
 You'll do some serious soul searching today. Which goals have you achieved and which ones have gone unattained? Be honest as you reflect on past months. Could you have done things differently? Would you like to do things differently in the future? You'd be well advised to write down your successes and regrets. Use the list to keep you on track. It's bound to be a great help to you.
 ----- 
 Today you'll realize that a clean slate brings with it the chance for a new beginning. You feel excited and optimistic about the future. Your goals are clear, and your mind is sharp. How can you not succeed? Take care not to let your fantasies run away with you. Keep your eyes on your attainable goals rather than waste time and energy chasing pipe dreams.
 ----- 
 You may be ready for some major career changes, Capricorn. You could be fed up with the stress and long hours of the corporate environment. Surely in this age of technology there's a way to spend more time at home without sacrificing the quality of your work. Think about it for a few days. If you propose a feasible alternative to your boss, the positive response may surprise you.
 ----- 
 Your intuition is working overtime today, Aquarius, making you sensitive to others' deepest emotions. It may be that the celestial atmosphere has everyone feeling open and honest, eager to grow into his or her most authentic self. Certainly, that's how you feel. Take some time out of your busy schedule to reflect on your regrets and successes. Be as true to yourself as possible.
 ----- 
 No pressure, Pisces, but as things are now, you might want to evaluate your career. Is it working out well? What are your latest achievements? What goals haven't been reached? If the answers aren't satisfactory, it's time to make some dramatic changes. If your work doesn't make your heart sing, it's time to find some that does. Life isn't a dress rehearsal. Get going!
 ----- 
 A friend may have some juicy gossip for you, Aries. Perhaps someone is getting married. You aren't the type to put too much stock in gossip, but your friend could be so convincing that you believe everything. Be skeptical! What you're hearing may not be outright lies, but it could be exaggerated. Wait until you see the people in question before accepting it as truth.
 ----- 
 A last
 ----- 
 Everything may look wrong to you today, Gemini. The house doesn't look right, the furniture needs adjusting, and you probably aren't happy with the way you look either. Your perfectionism could kick in and you might plunge into action, determined to make it all right. Don't bother! There's probably nothing you can do to make it look right today. Relax. You'll see things differently tomorrow.
 ----- 
 A small gathering in your neighborhood could attract interesting people, Cancer, but you may feel a little under the weather and consider staying home. Your energy may be lagging, as all energy does once in a while after a stressful time. It might do you good to make the effort and go if at all possible. It's up to you, of course, but enjoy the evening whatever you do.
 ----- 
 A quick check of your bank balance might reveal that it's a bit lower than you expected, Leo. You probably won't panic, but you're apt to feel a little disappointed. Don't waste time kicking yourself. Money can always be earned. Relax, resolve to tighten your belt a little, take care of the necessities, and stick with a financial plan. Soon you'll be glad you took action.
 ----- 
 Working late, Virgo? What could be so important that it keeps you from paying attention to your family or partner? Probably nothing! Take a good, objective look at what you think must be done tonight. You'll probably find that your company won't go broke if you leave some tasks. Get as much done as you can and then go home to your loved ones. They're important, too!
 ----- 
 An online prayer or meditation group could meet tonight, Libra, and you may get carried away with the spiritual dimensions these meditations take on. You feel comfortable with the people in this group, and you're grateful for the friendship and support they provide. Be with this feeling tonight, and try to hang onto it for as long as you can. It can help you through some rough times.
 ----- 
 Love matters have been going well for you recently, Scorpio, but today you could be alone and unable to reach a current or potential romantic interest. This could bring about a twinge of the blues, which up until now have passed you by. Don't waste time feeling down. Find something to distract you until your friend can come around to see you and you can have a little fun.
 ----- 
 You could go over your accounts today and find that there's considerably less there than you thought. It isn't serious, but it can still be disappointing. There could be a new contract in the final stages of negotiation that will prove favorable, and you can find a way to make up for the shortfall. In the meantime, cut expenses so finances stay healthy until the new contract materializes.
 ----- 
 Have you been going crazy with all the demands placed on you? Don't despair. Reflect on all that's been going on. Think about where you want to make changes. Once you've come to a decision, don't hesitate to implement it. This is easier than waiting for one big opportunity and doing it all at once. That chance may never come. The step
 ----- 
 If you're currently romantically involved, Aquarius, your lover could well go from what appears to be utter lassitude to total passion. This could throw you for a loop, and you might not know exactly how to deal with it. If you're single, you could meet someone you find attractive but forget to get his or her contact information! Keep paper and pen handy. You don't want to miss anything!
 ----- 
 Have you made plans to have a romantic interest come to your home, Pisces? If so, don't rush to get ready. Your friend is probably going to be late. Events beyond anyone's control have interfered, and you might have to wait. Don't make yourself crazy over it. Don't imagine all kinds of horrible scenarios. Your friend will show up even if later than planned. Have fun!
 ----- 
 An opportunity to increase your income by working in an artistic or innovative manner could come your way today, Aries. Technologies like film or computer graphics may be involved. You may have doubts about your ability to take this on, but that's only your insecurity. Don't be timid. Have a little confidence in yourself. Consider it all carefully. If it seems workable, go for it!
 ----- 
 Circumstances beyond your control may frustrate your desire to get together with a love partner today, Taurus. Work or family obligations could interfere. If your partner has to beg off, don't get upset and start doling out blame. This won't help and could put your friend on the defensive. Plan to meet another day. Absence makes the heart grow fonder!
 ----- 
 Family who mean a lot to you can make your home an even warmer and cozier place, Gemini. You'll probably spend a lot of time fixing it up in order to receive sincere compliments. The only downside might be that your current partner may not be there due to circumstances beyond anyone's control. Enjoy the visit and invite your family to return when your partner is there, if possible.
 ----- 
 A long but necessary phone call from a close friend or love partner could come at work today, Cancer. Matters of immediate concern need resolution. You might be uneasy about taking company time, and could even attract some unsettling attention, but you need to have this conversation now. It probably won't have any long
 ----- 
 Today you might discover a previously untapped talent, Leo, perhaps an artistic gift. This could be thrilling, but it will probably take some getting used to. Your first efforts might be tentative and uncertain, but this is what usually happens when you learn a new skill. Don't get discouraged yet! Give yourself time. Eventually you'll probably love what you do.
 ----- 
 You should be looking especially attractive, Virgo. You may have an ethereal, mystical look about you that attracts attention from strangers. This won't be lost on your friends, either. You could find it unsettling, particularly if people get too attentive or if a love partner gets jealous. Relax and enjoy it anyway. Needless to say, this is a great day to shop online for clothes!
 ----- 
 Your phone may seem haunted today, Libra. Calls might be filled with static, you could get some phantom rings, or callers may insist they tried to call when your phone never rang. There probably isn't any supernatural force at work, but it might be a good idea check with your phone company. There could be problems with your equipment.
 ----- 
 A reassessment of your financial goals may be needed now, Scorpio. Some of your expectations may be unrealistic, and you might need to look at them in a more practical light. This doesn't mean they won't happen, just that they're apt to take a little longer than you'd like. Think of it as an opportunity to develop patience. Rework your budget and hang in there!
 ----- 
 Are you romantically attracted to someone you know through work, Sagittarius? If so, this isn't a good time to pursue it. You might be wearing your heart on your sleeve a little too obviously. This could be unsettling for your friend, and it might sabotage the results you're hoping for. Be patient and let the relationship develop. Your feelings could well be mutual!
 ----- 
 Inspiration for writing, music, drawing, painting, or other creative activities could hover just out of reach today, Capricorn. Great ideas could pop into your head and out just as quickly. The only way to avoid the frustration of missing out on wonderful ideas is to write them down as soon as they come. Making notes can also stimulate further inspiration. Go for it!
 ----- 
 Today you could run into an old friend and suddenly see him or her in a different light. A romantic, sensual attraction you never believed possible could suddenly seem overwhelming. Try to gauge if this person feels the same way. If so, plan a date. Don't write this possibility off because you've labeled this person a "friend."
 ----- 
 A current or potential love relationship could hit a snag as you have a clash of wills. If either of you is stubborn, this could turn into an unpleasant power struggle. Try to work out a course of action that creates a win/win situation, so neither of you feels compromised. In this way, the development of your relationship will progress rather than regress.
 ----- 
 The time is right to pursue training for a particular skill or finish a degree in a field of interest to you, Aries. Presently, great success and good fortune are indicated when you assert your considerable energy and focus on the subject matter. If you've been considering honing your communication skills, consider a writing course. Perhaps you want to organize a long
 ----- 
 Circumstances are favorable for you if you're contemplating investment in real estate. Any sort of investment looks good for you right now, Taurus. Be ready to have an important conversation with a young person today. You may benefit from a significant piece of mail or phone call. Even if you hadn't planned on it, you may want to visit an older friend or relative tonight, if possible.
 ----- 
 Did you forget to take two aspirin before you fell into bed last night? This morning you may feel in a fog, but it should lift around midday. You could be surprised by some heartening news from a friend or relative regarding a difficult situation that is now being resolved. Enjoy the boost of energy that this good news gives you.
 ----- 
 If it's true that you reap what you sow, Cancer, you're in for a great harvest in the coming months. Your hard work and focus will start to pay off handsomely with promotions and raises just when you may have given up on being acknowledged for all you do. Hang on to your great energy, passion, and enthusiasm. Doors are about to open for you. Get ready to walk through them.
 ----- 
 You're highly esteemed in your profession because of your strong business acumen and no
 ----- 
 Opportunity may knock for you today from an unlikely source, perhaps total strangers! Use your intuition to follow potential leads. Real estate, particularly residential, looks especially promising for realizing financial gain for you right now. Follow your hunches and see what develops. Don't let your caution bog you down at the moment. It could be surprisingly wonderful.
 ----- 
 Expect to receive interesting communications today, Libra. You might hear from a long
 ----- 
 You're in a great position to reap the rewards from all your past hard work, Scorpio. In the coming weeks you'll be able to realize important gains in your career and personal projects. Not only should you see significant advancements in your work life, but you'll also achieve greater personal happiness. You have great momentum, so keep it up and you'll realize your goals.
 ----- 
 With the current celestial energy, you might be going on a trip, Sagittarius. It may be for business, pleasure, or both. It's likely that this trip will achieve certain goals. Perhaps you're aiming for a promotion. Chances are you'll be successful in your ambitions. Or you may be ready to set out on your own and start a new business. It's an excellent time for this, too.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if money comes from an unlikely source. It could be a surprisingly good return on an investment or a bequest from a relative. Pay attention to any dreams that seem to repeat. They may hold a lesson about understanding your life path. You may receive an unexpected visit from a dear friend you haven't heard from in years. All in all, this is a great time.
 ----- 
 This is a good time to forge new relationships, Aquarius. Be open
 ----- 
 You're feeling your power and strength today, Pisces. You've worked hard to get into good physical shape. Similarly, you've exerted a great deal of energy in your work life and it's paying off. With today's planetary energy, you can also expect greater intimacy in your personal life. Enjoy this special time.
 ----- 
 There could be trouble brewing in the workplace, Aries. Some of your colleagues neither like nor trust each other and find it impossible to work together. Adjustments are needed if everyone is going to work to the best of their abilities. If you're in a position to handle this, do it now. If you aren't, distance yourself from the situation. It's the only way to stay sane!
 ----- 
 Squabbles may come up between you and a sibling or neighbor, Taurus. Your ability to compromise is definitely called for here. If you aren't careful, this could turn into a battle of wills. The minute the disagreement comes up, try to talk it out and turn it into a win/win situation. Otherwise, things may be said that shouldn't be, and feelings could remain hurt for a long time.
 ----- 
 Money matters might cause you a few headaches, Gemini. You could be torn between the desire to put money aside for the future and the impulse to buy something that you've wanted for a long time. There may be a way to have it both ways. Save a little less and try to find a bargain price for your item. Take everything into consideration and work it out before you make yourself crazy.
 ----- 
 Too much rigorous exercise over the past few days might have you feeling a little sore and tired, Cancer. Your nerves may be on edge, and you could be more likely than usual to snap at those around you. Try to ease both nerves and muscle aches by soaking in a hot bath. Herbal tea might also help. Accept that you should take it easy today and then do it!
 ----- 
 Spiritual breakthroughs may have you feeling a little disconcerted, Leo. Clearing away deadwood, such as past traumas, might tell you a few things about yourself you'd rather not face. It's vital to release them in order to progress as a human being. Even if tears are involved, this is a positive development. You'll feel happier once it's all set free. Onward and upward!
 ----- 
 A virtual conference of some kind could touch upon some pretty volatile issues, Virgo. People could disagree to the point that the meeting turns into a shouting match. You probably have strong opinions on this as well, but don't get involved. You won't be able to stop the argument, and it can only cause you stress. If you can, avoid joining this meeting altogether. Think about it!
 ----- 
 Is your significant other caught up in family problems and unable to spend time with you? Don't let your insecurity get the best of you. Your partner needs to deal with family now. Relax, do what you want to do, and have confidence that you'll be spending more time together as soon as possible. After dealing with family quarrels, you'll be a peaceful refuge for your partner.
 ----- 
 Matters involving communication seem to be fouled up, Scorpio. Messages may not get delivered, emails may not go through, and people might misinterpret your words. This could create a mess that brings everything to a screeching halt. You need to speak to people directly, give detailed instructions, use simple language, and make sure they take notes, or beware of the consequences!
 ----- 
 Your values could oppose those of a business or romantic partner today, Sagittarius. One of you may be overly pragmatic and the other too idealistic. One seems callous, while the other seems to be living in a dream world. This could be a milestone in your relationship if approached properly. If you can't create a win/win situation, perhaps you should reconsider the partnership.
 ----- 
 If you've been having trouble reaching a romantic partner, Capricorn, it might be a good idea to stop trying. Your friend is having a rough day and might not make the best company. In fact, your beloved could view a call from you as an unwelcome interruption and be short, if not downright rude. If you speak with your friend, keep it brief and plan to get together 
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit restless and unsettled without really knowing why, Aquarius. Stresses on the job could churn up repressed resentment from the past that you need to release. Try to discern exactly what these stresses remind you of. If you're unable to do this, however, you'll probably still reap the benefits of the release. Stay focused on your work and just let it happen.
 ----- 
 Too many people could be vying for your attention today, Pisces. All of them want advice or help. This could be flattering, and you'll probably want to help them, but it can also be unsettling and make it hard to focus. Don't let this set your temper on edge and cause you to snap at your friends. Take each request one at a time, make no promises, and do your best.
 ----- 
 Does your house look like a cyclone hit it? Your tidy nature should drive you to clean it up. In the course of wading through the mess, don't be surprised if you discover some objects you thought you'd lost forever. Once you finish, you'll probably find that the place looks beautiful, better than it did before it was messed up. Something good can indeed come out of chaos.
 ----- 
 An exciting phone call or email could come from a friend who has some great news for you, Taurus. Love, romance, and success in the arts are all highlighted now, and this communication could bring it to your attention. Conversations could bring inspiration your way, and your mind is apt to be going a thousand miles an hour for most of the day. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 An online group could form today, Gemini, perhaps friends who are involved in the arts or meditation or spiritual studies. This group is likely to be close, probably through mutual interests, so communicating with them this evening should be both intellectually stimulating and emotionally gratifying. What takes place today could also bring healing of some kind, either for you or for someone else.
 ----- 
 Communication involving romance could come unexpectedly today, Cancer. You may get a loving message from a romantic partner, or you could hear of a wedding to take place in the future amongst your circle of friends. You could also read a love poem or romance novel or write something along the same lines yourself! Someone might also express affection to you. Don't be surprised. You deserve it!
 ----- 
 A chance to increase your income by participating in an artistic project of some kind could come your way today, Leo. You might take part in the creative work or you could promote it in a business capacity. Whichever it is, you're likely to form some firm friendships in the process. If you're single, one of your colleagues might turn out to be a potential love partner. Enjoy!
 ----- 
 Have you been feeling stagnant lately, Virgo, as if your life is going nowhere? What happens today could change that. An unusual group event could put you in touch with people who open new intellectual, career, or spiritual doors for you. Stimulating conversations could turn your head toward opportunities that you were never aware of before. Onward and upward!
 ----- 
 Inspiration could hit today, Libra. It's a beautiful feeling, but you might not be sure how to channel it. It could represent a spiritual breakthrough, artistic inspiration, increased understanding of others, or all of the above. What's almost certain is that you'll want to spend time alone to take it all in and figure out how to use it. Don't dismiss any possibility, however outrageous it may seem.
 ----- 
 You might have the chance to speak with new people in interesting fields, perhaps from foreign lands, Scorpio. Your conversational abilities are at an all
 ----- 
 Information gleaned from surprising sources could lead to sudden, fortunate career breaks, Sagittarius. You might explore totally new fields, although this could be temporary. Your efforts should attract the attention of those who matter and eventually lead to advancement or a raise. Don't be afraid to continue to explore these sources. Keep up the good work!
 ----- 
 A passionate encounter with a love partner might cement the bond between you so thoroughly that you start talking about commitment or even a wedding. A romantic haze may permeate your interactions. Still, exercise some restraint in expressing your feelings. Hitting your friend with too much at once could have the opposite effect from the one you're hoping for. Be patient!
 ----- 
 Have you been feeling less than your normal self, Aquarius? If so, today you may suddenly regain your strength and be raring to go. You might even be tempted to start a rigorous exercise program. Go ahead and start, but pace yourself and try not to make up for lost time all at once. You need to ease into these things. Maybe start with walking and yoga.
 ----- 
 Love and romance aren't just part of your life today, Pisces, they're your whole life. If you're single, an exciting potential partner could have you reeling. If you're currently involved, recent events may have created such a powerful bond between you and your beloved that you think it will never end. Consider what led to this feeling and find a way to repeat it. This can only benefit you.
 ----- 
 You might not get the things done that you want to do today, Aries, but don't sweat it. Go easy on yourself if you still have a few unchecked things on the list tonight. People may pop out of nowhere and demand your attention for much of the time. Listen, be present, and try not to think of the things that aren't getting done. Focus on those things that are getting done.
 ----- 
 Today is a fantastic day, Taurus, so make the most of it. If you're emotionally and mentally prepared to go on a new, exciting life journey, the opportunity will present itself. The energy will be fast and furious. You can work harmoniously with electrical gadgets and new technologies. Break free of the mundane and seek less conventional ways of living.
 ----- 
 You'll be tested today, Gemini, so brace yourself for the unexpected. A large piece of your life is coming into question at this time, and you're being forced to face the music. Is this something that really rings true with your inner being? If it is, you should be able to deal with this challenge. If you're struggling, perhaps you should take this as a sign that you need a major life change.
 ----- 
 You have lots of energy at your disposal today, Cancer, but it's erratic and powerful. You have the stamina to make major changes, and the opportunity to break free from any restrictions that hold you back. Embrace the new, fresh aspects of your life that ring true to your freedom
 ----- 
 It's time to take a bold step forward, Leo. Have confidence in yourself and all the careful planning you've been painstakingly doing for the past few months. Realize that much of this hard work is paying off, but only if you're willing to take the next step. The opportunity is there. All you need to do is jump on it. Act out of faith and confidence instead of fear and restriction.
 ----- 
 You can't ask for a better day, Virgo. Positive energy is coming your way. You should look for the opportunities that are right in front of you. You may be going through some significant upheaval right now. Clear away all the things that have limited you in the past. The future is wide open. Empower yourself to make the changes necessary to build your life way you want it to be.
 ----- 
 Be on your toes today, Libra, and expect the unexpected. People may be acting out in rash, outlandish ways, so go with the flow. As usual, you have a tremendous ability to roll with the punches and still come out unscathed. Just take care that someone else isn't grabbing the reins. Stay laid
 ----- 
 If you've put in your time and done your homework, this day can prove very rewarding, Scorpio. Watch out for incredible opportunities hiding nearby. You have a great deal of physical energy today, although you may find it erratic and a bit out of control. Break free of anything that seems to be binding you. Shed the chains and live the way you want to live.
 ----- 
 You may find people very stubborn today, so take care, Sagittarius. Arguments can explode out of nowhere, so have your helmet ready. Think before you act and don't feel pressured to get involved in something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Remember that it's OK to just walk away. No one will win the boxing match, so don't even get in the ring.
 ----- 
 Initiate a major change in your life, Capricorn. Break free of the humdrum and launch into something exciting. Take part in an online class that expands your mind. Consider yoga, tarot, or any form of martial arts. You have a tremendous amount of energy today. It will help you maintain confidence and endurance as you do the groundwork to put this new life
 ----- 
 Action is the word of the day. Whether you're initiating it or feeling the brunt of it, you'll be caught up in the vortex of it. Try not to lose your tempter today, Aquarius, and don't be surprised if people act rashly and insensitively. Perhaps this is their way of saying they need you and that your energy and input are important. Have confidence in your words.
 ----- 
 Today may be filled with sudden changes and unexpected events, Pisces. The energy is electric and strong. People will act in erratic, powerful bursts. Try to stay centered and maintain your focus. Keep in mind that if you need to break free from certain limitations, now is the time to make that move. Have confidence in your actions and make it happen.
 ----- 
 You could be quite busy today as friends from far away call for long
 ----- 
 Some fascinating news could come from a friend who's presently out of town, Taurus. This might be personal, but it more likely involves new discoveries in a field that interests you both. You'll probably want to do some research of your own, so be prepared to spend time in the library or online over the next few weeks. Keep careful records. You won't want to forget a thing!
 ----- 
 Friends who are interested in psychic and metaphysical matters could contact you today, Gemini. You may discuss a lot of fascinating material, which could alter your value system in a subtle but profound way. Don't be surprised if you do more listening than talking on this occasion. It's important to soak in as much as you can. Write it down if you think you'll forget it.
 ----- 
 A rush of physical energy may hit you this morning, Cancer, and you could feel like you have no outlet for it. But a sibling or neighbor may need some help, so you'll definitely be able to put that energy to work. It should be a good day for everyone. Your friend will receive some valuable help with an important matter, and you'll be able to make use of all that vigor.
 ----- 
 Invaluable help with money or property concerns could come to you from an unexpected quarter today, Leo. Someone you didn't know possessed the appropriate information could offer it out of the blue, making a big difference to the way you handle these matters. The situation may not be all that dire to begin with, but all should be well by day's end.
 ----- 
 Are you looking for a particular piece of information, Virgo? A friend, possibly another Virgo, has this information but is unaware that you're searching for it. Don't be afraid to let all your friends and acquaintances know that you need to find some specific facts. The person who finally comes forward may surprise you. Enjoy your day!
 ----- 
 The opportunity to fly somewhere might come up today, Libra. Career changes are in the wind, and while they might seem rather unsettling at first, they'll be positive in the long run. This could involve a raise or promotion, transfer, new job, or even new career. Don't fight it. It might be scary, but it's a blessing in disguise. Go with the flow.
 ----- 
 Have you been having difficulties with career or money matters, Scorpio? If so, help might come today from a friend who lives far away.

Write it down so you'll be sure to remember it.
 ----- 
 Today, a flash of inspiration may resolve an obstacle to your career advancement that presented itself in the past few days, Sagittarius.

You may feel so good about resolving this that you'll want to go out and celebrate. Go for it!
 ----- 
 Are you presently negotiating a contract, Capricorn? If you and the other party disagree on any points, these differences will most likely be resolved. You'll probably come up with an idea that creates a win/win situation so both of you feel good about it. This will strengthen your relationship considerably, so expect partnership matters to progress smoothly. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Professional difficulties could be resolved by outside assistance, Aquarius. Equipment may have gone haywire, or miscommunications could have led to snarls. Perhaps you need to call in a consultant. It's possible that you might come up with the right solution at the right time and earn some well
 ----- 
 Idealistic romantic notions join with intense sensual passion to create powerful desire that stays with you throughout the day, Pisces.

 Someone you've never met before who you find exceedingly attractive could pass you today. You might decide to go say hello and discover not only a physical attraction but an intellectual compatibility as well. Your feelings are probably reciprocated! If you're single, this attraction might be worth pursuing. If you're involved, at least you might make a new friend.
 ----- 
 Career and money matters continue to go well for you, Gemini, and probably romance, too. Your life may be the envy of others, but you probably feel there's still something missing. This is a good day to explore metaphysical and spiritual studies. It's a time of transition, and this sort of interest can make things easier for you, especially if those close to you share your interest.
 ----- 
 Romance and creativity are the driving forces in your life today, Cancer. You might find that feelings for a special person provide lots of inspiration for creative projects. Your creative energy makes you that much more attractive to the one you love most. This could prove to be an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying day. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 You tend to be down to Earth and practical, Leo, but now you feel like indulging in some flights of fancy. Romance or fantasy novels could be especially appealing right now. You might even toy with the idea of writing one of your own. If you're currently romantically involved, your sweetheart might want to do something special with you tonight. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 An affectionate letter, phone call, or email could come to you from an old friend, Virgo, expressing gratitude for past favors. This is going to make you feel warm and loving toward this person, and you'll want to reciprocate in kind. Invite him or her for coffee and have a long conversation. The bond between you is strong.

You're also likely to feel more attuned than usual to the thoughts and feelings of others. Don't be surprised if you intuitively give people what they want and need before they ask.
 ----- 
 Yes, you may have another cookie, Aries. Enjoy it and don't feel guilty. Guilt is useless. Today, get rid of regret. Express your emotions but don't dwell on them. Your sensitivity is acute, so put up your psychic shield. You might pick up on others' intense energy, so be careful. Sympathize with others, but don't take on their garbage. They need to take out their own trash.
 ----- 
 You might just want to stay on the couch today, Taurus. That's fine. Don't get up if you don't want to. You're probably better off sticking close to home and enjoying a good movie tonight. If people ask how you're doing, be honest. Others will be able to see right through you, so don't try to hide your feelings. Today is a good day to say how you really feel.
 -----

People will be particularly drawn to this side of you, especially tonight.
 ----- 
 Put your businesslike nature aside for the day and focus on your feelings, Leo. You may be a bit protective of your emotions, but realize that much of what you're feeling is best experienced through expressing it to others. Reach down deep and get in touch with what you truly believe to be the heart of the issue. Your thinking is clear as can be today, so enjoy it!
 ----- 
 Call or write a letter to a friend today, Virgo. Your brain may feel like it's stuck in a rut, which is probably best remedied by sharing these feelings with others.

 ----- 
 It may be much easier than usual to express your emotions to someone today, Sagittarius. If there has been something on your mind for a while, now is the time to say it.

 ----- 
 Does it feel like someone's raining on your parade today, Capricorn? No surprise there. You may feel like you're stuck in a bog, so wear your galoshes and give it your best shot. That's all you can do. People may be extra touchy and impatient with ridiculous banter, even if it is polite. Try not to make sense of things that seem confusing now. Come back to them in a couple days.
 ----- 
 Your intuition is extra keen today, Aquarius, and your mental aim is on target. Other people may sink into the swamp, but you're the life raft they can cling to. Your amazing mental clarity will be invaluable throughout the day. You'll be able to communicate your feelings clearly, and you should find their receptivity to your thoughts much greater than usual.
 ----- 
 You might find the mood of today a bit too somber for your liking, Pisces. Why is everyone so serious? Whether you figure out the answer or not, just know that it probably isn't something you did. Emotions that have been building up are likely to express themselves now, much like a volcano bursting under the pressure of tons of molten lava.
 ----- 
 Ask for help if you need it, Aries. Your nature is to serve others, but in order to maintain that energy, make sure that you're taken care of as well. Offer extra support to the people you love. In work
 ----- 
 Keeping your emotions in balance is going to be the key to a successful day, Taurus. Don't get swept away by a fanciful situation that could send your mind spinning. Maintain control at all times.

 ----- 
 You may feel like you're running into a brick wall at every turn, Gemini, especially when it comes to emotions. The intensity of the day may have you feeling like you're in a pressure cooker.

 -----

The key to taking advantage of this is to stay close to the things that truly bring you the most happiness. The details will work themselves out with almost no effort. Have faith that you'll succeed, and you will.
 ----- 
 Make sure you're getting enough sleep, Leo. You may seem groggy and your head could be a bit cloudy today, but try not to let this stop you from getting your work done. Much of what you perceive may not exactly correlate with reality. Your emotions could be especially distorted. You may have a strong desire to escape into a fantasy world. Try to keep both feet on the ground.
 ----- 
 There may be an area of your life that seems completely fanciful now, Virgo. The issues regarding it have become a bit hazy. You may no longer be sure of the reality of the situation. Today's energies will bring these issues into focus. Your emotions are especially heightened, and they, too, will seem a bit clouded. Try to stay balanced and gain a new perspective on the situation.
 ----- 
 Your fantasy life is especially active today, Libra, so enjoy this little break into your dream world. Coming back to reality may be difficult. Keep tabs on your emotions so they don't get the better of you. The impressions you receive from the outside world may not be accurate today. Keep your wits about you and try not to get caught up in drugs and alcohol.
 ----- 
 You're in a fun
 ----- 
 You may have a strange paranoia that people are out to get you today, Sagittarius, but don't let this feeling paralyze you. Your emotions are more than likely getting the better of you. The reality of the situation is much different than your sensitive emotions perceive. Avoid the tendency to escape even further into this fantasy world. Stay away from drugs or alcohol.
 ----- 
 Your fantasy world is piqued today, Capricorn. Your imagination is running wild. Maintain a certain amount of control over your emotions or they may get the better of you. You could find yourself in a cloud of confusion by afternoon. Avoid this by trying to ground yourself throughout the day. Make sure your actions result from an equal balance between thought and emotion.
 ----- 
 You may get the feeling that you're operating in an emotional crossfire today, Aquarius. On the one hand, you may have a "me first," selfish feeling that demands attention from others. You may also sense the need to work to serve others and bring like
 ----- 
 You'll enjoy a day of high spirits and friendly interactions. The energy of the day is in your favor, although it may not seem like it. Your emotions may become cloudy and it might seem like people are working against you. Although this may be true to some extent, realize that much of this paranoia comes more from your emotional insecurity than another's plot against you.
 ----- 
 A financial windfall might open new doors for you, Aries, and you could consider making some major changes in your life. You might think about moving to a nicer home. Romance is definitely on your mind. If you aren't already involved in a domestic situation, you might consider it seriously right now. Change can be frightening, but these changes are good. Don't hesitate.
 ----- 
 Expect some positive changes in a current partnership, Taurus. If this is a business partnership, a new agreement between you shows promise of success and good fortune. If this is a romance, you might be so perfectly compatible that you're considering moving to the next level of commitment. Any new partnership begun today should be promising and bring you whatever you hope to gain.
 ----- 
 Have you been working out, following a new dietary program, or both, Gemini? If so, today you could look in the mirror and for the first time see some tangible and positive results. You're probably looking and feeling great. Don't abandon your efforts. You'll want to continue the progress. Keep the energy flowing by going for a run or other workout, then treat yourself to a small indulgence.
 ----- 
 Have you been thinking about relocating, Cancer? The siren song of distant states or exotic lands may play constantly in your ears. Foreign cultures could inspire you artistically, spiritually, and personally. This is actually a time when few things are out of your reach. If you're serious about this, look into it. You can decide once you have all the facts.
 ----- 
 Expect something new to take place regarding your home today, Leo. A family member could come for a visit or even move in. You could be redecorating, landscaping, or buying new furniture. There is always the possibility that you're moving. Whatever the changes, they're likely to be positive despite the messy and disruptive process of making them. You've got a lot to look forward to!
 ----- 
 Some wonderful news could come to you, Virgo, possibly from a sibling or neighbor. It might involve money or a new opportunity that's opening up nearby. A group event concerning a subject you're very interested in could also take place. You might feel you have a lot of phone calls to make and plans to think about. The future looks bright. Enjoy!
 ----- 
 An opportunity to bring in extra income might arrive today, Libra, possibly through a female friend. Another Libra might be involved. This probably involves a special, temporary project, but it could prove enjoyable and profitable. A love partner might want to participate, too. Think about it before committing. Talk to people who have done this before. It's worth a try, anyway.
 ----- 
 This is a day of fresh beginnings for you, Scorpio. Accomplishments in the past foster a new sense of self
 ----- 
 If you've never tried your hand at the arts, Sagittarius, this is the day to do it. Your imagination and ingenuity are flying high, and your aesthetic sense is acute right now. If you aren't already involved with such activities, look online to see what classes or workshops are offered. Get a friend to sign up with you. You'll probably have a great time!
 ----- 
 You could encounter a potential romantic partner today, Capricorn. You'll probably communicate with this person at a virtual group event and hit it off immediately. This person is likely to be bright, physically attractive, kindhearted, and sensitive. If you're single and available, don't pass up this opportunity. Take advantage of the chance to get to know each other. Who knows where this might lead?
 ----- 
 A lot of changes could be taking place in your life now, Aquarius. Even though most of them are positive, the upheaval can be unsettling right now. Don't give in to panic. Nothing needs to be done that you can't handle. Take each task one step at a time. As you vault each hurdle, the road ahead seems that much smoother. When you arrive, all will be well. Keep going!
 ----- 
 New beginnings and promising new opportunities may appear from a distant state or foreign country, Pisces. Your adventurous side is excited and enthusiastic, but the side of you that wants to stay settled could put up some resistance. Don't feel you have to jump into anything. Get all the facts and assess the situation objectively. Think seriously about it all. What do you most want?
 ----- 
 Stress could have you feeling uncommunicative today. You probably aren't going to want to talk to anyone, even your dearest friend, Aries. This might prove difficult, as people around you are going to ask for advice and help. Keep your cool. This feeling will pass, and you won't want anyone to think you're upset. Go to lunch alone, and tonight crash into bed with a good book.
 ----- 
 Finances should be going well, Taurus, but your financial affairs aren't something you want to talk about to anyone now. Perhaps you want to make a decision that's yours and not influenced by others. Nonetheless, a close friend or lover is going to find out. Maybe they'll guess or maybe you'll let it slip. Don't panic. This person understands you and won't try to exert undue influence.
 ----- 
 You're likely to be in a solitary mood today, Gemini, and probably want to spend the evening reading or working on a project of your own. However, it isn't likely to work out that way. Family could drop by or some equipment could go on the blink and require repairs. Some unexpected calls could come your way. Take a deep breath and summon your good manners. You can be alone tomorrow.
 ----- 
 Today you might have a strange feeling that something is wrong, perhaps in the neighborhood or with a friend or relative. This is probably going to bother you all day, Cancer, so it might be a good idea to call this person or otherwise look into the matter. There's probably nothing really wrong, but someone close to you may have just experienced a shock of some kind.
 ----- 
 An organization with which you're affiliated may be having financial problems, and this fact could come out today. It might be a shock to you and everyone else involved, Leo, but it's good that it's coming out now. This revelation might have a profound effect on your goals, and may necessitate some reevaluation. Some intense discussion with those around you is definitely indicated.
 ----- 
 Some unexpected changes that have been kept under wraps at the workplace could come out soon. They may involve reorganization or a change of ownership. This is going profoundly affect your attitude toward your job. It could cause you to consider making a change of your own. This isn't the time to make a decision. Take a few days to consider your options before making up your mind.
 ----- 
 Some disconcerting revelations about your past or the past of someone close to you could come out today. This might be a bit of a shock, Libra, but it's a positive development, nonetheless. It will shed some light on how to deal with current issues in your life or a relationship. Write down your thoughts, meditate, talk to a friend, or otherwise try to make sense of it.
 ----- 
 Something you might have wanted to keep between you and a few trusted friends could inadvertently be revealed, perhaps to the wrong people. Frustration and a sense of betrayal could plague you, but don't turn against those who knew. Even though this can be disconcerting, you can learn from it. Benjamin Franklin said, "Two people can keep a secret only when one of them is dead."
 ----- 
 Demands placed on you by work colleagues could have you stressed, Sagittarius. You might feel that your co
 ----- 
 Stress and job frustration might have you thinking about breaking free, walking out the door, and going somewhere else. Another thought is likely to concern going back to school and training for a career in another field. You might need a vacation, and returning to school could be a great idea in the future, but don't decide today. Wait a few days at least.
 ----- 
 A close friend or loved one might drop out of sight today. You may panic when he or she doesn't return your phone calls. Don't jump to conclusions. They're preoccupied with matters that for the moment appear important and will contact you in time. When you do finally connect, you could hear some interesting news. Relax, go about your business, and look forward to the call.
 ----- 
 A household member might toy with the idea of moving out or going away for a while, Pisces. This could stress you out, but don't make yourself crazy. Don't try to talk him or her out of it. Listen sympathetically and let your relative get it out of their system. This person is probably feeling temporarily restricted by forces outside the home and isn't really likely to go anywhere.
 ----- 
 Your health should be in top shape today, Aries. You're likely to feel physically, emotionally, and spiritually strong and ready to tap into your inner power. Dreams may make it possible to release old traumas and move ahead. An increased understanding of the needs and desires of others enriches your relationships. Take heart from past success, continue as you are, and enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 You're good at dealing with others, but today you should be especially so. Your intuition is strong and you're likely to instinctively understand others' thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires. You give freely of your experience, knowledge, and understanding. This brings others closer to you, which can work for you on many levels. Virtual social events may bring new friends.
 ----- 
 You generally are good at sizing up other people and sensing their thoughts and feelings, Gemini, but today that talent is greatly enhanced by increased intuition. You should be feeling especially enthusiastic and optimistic today. Both work and home life are likely to be looking good. Physically, you should be healthy and vigorous, and spiritually you should be strong. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Communication with close friends and a romantic partner should be especially beneficial today, Cancer, since you're feeling more in touch with those close to you. Children could also be a source of joy today. Your creativity and inspiration are strong, so this is a great day to start new projects. Your enthusiasm and optimism should propel you to new achievements. Enjoy!
 ----- 
 Recent successes could lead to new aspirations to increase your socioeconomic standing. You should be feeling especially determined and confident about your future. Your plans have worked out well. You're feeling close to family, as your intuition level is high, and you can sense what they're thinking and feeling. Career and relationships look promising. Enjoy!
 ----- 
 Normally you tend to view things on a logical, intellectual level, Virgo, but today the strength of your intuition could surprise you. Your communications could be subtler than words. Today you're probably feeling especially optimistic, enthusiastic, and very inspired by your circumstances. Continue on your path!
 ----- 
 Artistic talents are greatly increased by fresh, deeply felt inspiration. Today you may spend much of your time giving material form to your ideas. You're intuitive by nature, but today your psychic gifts are operating at a high level. Don't write off any insights you receive. Instead, write them down. Don't forget to keep paper and pen next to your bed. You'll want to remember your ideas and dreams later.
 ----- 
 This is a time when you're likely to feel especially idealistic and hopeful. Spiritual experiences may have you on cloud nine, Scorpio. Your intuition is also strong. You might consider taking a future trip to a distant state or foreign country, perhaps one associated with a great spiritual tradition. Wait a day or two and talk it over with friends before making any specific arrangements.
 ----- 
 During this time, you'll feel especially intuitive, optimistic, and spiritually on a roll. You could feel artistically inspired, Sagittarius, and channel some of your newfound awareness into recently started projects. Your relationships are probably going well. Your increased understanding of others' needs makes you generous with sympathy or assistance where needed. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Online group activities that you attend today are likely to be spiritually oriented, such as group meditations. You could communicate with new friends from faraway places who share your interests.

 Some vivid and wonderful dreams might provide inspiration for future creative projects. You're feeling cheerful and optimistic now, and your enthusiasm is likely to continue. Success in career and relationships is indicated. Your increased intuition heightens your understanding of others. Don't be surprised if friends and colleagues line up for your support and guidance.
 ----- 
 You might find yourself thinking about a possible future vacation. You've worked hard during the last few months and feel you deserve a break. This year you're likely to want to do something different from the norm, perhaps travel to a foreign land associated with a great spiritual tradition, if possible. You should feel closer to your loved ones and optimistic about the future. Enjoy!
 ----- 
 Don't let others' bad moods get you down, Aries. And don't feel it's your responsibility to cheer them up. Their moodiness is their business, not yours. You could be a little bit anxious today, and allowing yourself to be negatively influenced by others will do you no good at all. The general atmosphere will improve in a few days.
 ----- 
 It's time to let go of the past and focus only on the future, Taurus. A new person may come into your life who can help you do just that. Communication with close friends and relatives is highlighted, and you may find yourself spending more time on the phone than usual. Enjoy this day as you anticipate your brilliant future!
 ----- 
 There's definitely a downside to home ownership! Much as you love projects, Gemini, the joy is tempered when the chores never end. While your home is structurally sound, it may need some cosmetic enhancement. Try adding plants and flowers indoors. Outside, a few strategically placed pots can act as attractive focal points. You can make a difference with little effort or expense.
 ----- 
 The glass may look half empty, but only at first glance. Keep looking at it, or perhaps change the way you look at it, and you'll see that it indeed is half full. You may be experiencing some frustration. Computers could be down, or communication hindered in some way. Don't get stressed. See this as an ideal time to relax since you can't get any work done anyway.
 ----- 
 There are lots of personal and financial issues to resolve today, Leo. You may hear from your bank or see some alarming numbers on an ATM receipt. Don't get upset. Ultimately, these matters will be resolved to your benefit. As for personal matters, you may learn some new information about someone you thought you knew well. A relationship you once considered close may not be.
 ----- 
 A rising tide lifts all boats. When someone close experiences a windfall or especially good luck, Virgo, the ripple effect reaches you. Change is in the air. While everything happening is positive, sometimes it feels like it's going too quickly. You feel a bit off balance, with little or no time to adjust. Even windfalls take some getting used to. Give yourself time to settle into the new circumstances.
 ----- 
 It looks as though change is on the horizon at work, Libra. You've just recently completed some long
 ----- 
 Crazy as it seems, why not plan that trip you've been eager to go on, Scorpio? Adventure calls, and although there are a few obstacles to stop you from answering, you cant wait to get out of your rut. There is a great big world out there, and you cant wait to make the time to go and see some of it!
 ----- 
 Prosperity is just around the corner, Sagittarius. With it comes change. Change in your job, career, or environment figures prominently today. However this change manifests, it's bound to be positive. You're lucky, and you're about to hit the road to even greater success. Savor this moment, for you'll be busy soon!
 ----- 
 Your world is changing, Capricorn, both internally and externally. You feel a need to broaden your horizons. You may be contemplating a move to a new neighborhood or trip to a faraway land. The people in your life will change as a result of this. You're about to embark on a new phase of life, and these new friends will act as able guides.
 ----- 
 Romance is in the air today, Aquarius. It's likely that your relationship with your loved ones will see a dramatic improvement. Perhaps some flowers will arrive unexpectedly, or you'll be paid a sincere compliment. Harmony reigns in the work environment as well. Both people and machines run smoothly and efficiently.
 ----- 
 You're focused and attentive to detail. Some longstanding projects benefit from this sudden spurt of energy and get completed in record time. Children figure prominently in your life right now, Pisces. Is there one child in particular who needs some extra attention from you? Your love and support mean a lot more than you realize.
 ----- 
 You like to be honest with those you care about, but today you're likely to be a bit too honest. Don't be too quick to take offense and watch the tendency to be too blunt. If you temper your honesty with some diplomacy, you should get your message across with a minimum of hurt feelings. You create win/win situations that way. It's best for all involved.
 ----- 
 It might feel like your home has turned into Grand Central Station. Lots of family members present, deliveries made and phones ringing, and you may just want to watch TV or read a book. This could lead to some understandable irritation. However, be your usual polite self. If possible, get a family member to screen your callers. You might be frustrated, but you don't want to offend anybody.
 ----- 
 You might have to do a lot of running around when you probably want to stay home. Obligations to friends and family are likely to come up, and even though you're a bit tired you'll want to help out. The best plan for today is to get everything done as quickly as possible and then spend the rest of the day relaxing alone. You can have it both ways!
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if lots of people contact you today. Perhaps you're in the mood to gossip or neighbors have news of changes nearby. You should be brimming with energy, so you can handle it, but you might find it a bit unnerving if communication gets too hectic. It's best just to go with the flow and enjoy situations like this. You can think about what it all means later.
 ----- 
 You could be feeling a bit antsy today and may want to spend time exercising or trying a new sport or game that you've never played before. This is great. Ask some friends to join you, if possible. Don't push yourself past your limits. This can only bring exhaustion or injury, and it won't help your fitness level. Exercise within your limitations and do it more often.
 ----- 
 An exciting communication could inform you of an advancement opportunity that you should explore. While you'd be quick to act under normal circumstances, Virgo, today you might be more cautious. You've sought recognition for a while, so don't be too reticent. Don't let your insecurity get the better of you. Learn all you can about the situation and then make an informed decision.
 ----- 
 A friend could ask for a loan and you might hesitate to give him or her the money. Follow your instincts. The person probably isn't too savvy about money. You might want to participate in some group activities, but don't let people take unfair advantage of you. You're willing to serve those who need you but discriminate between those who do and don't really need your help.
 ----- 
 Today you're likely to experience a powerful burst of energy that may temporarily turn you into a workaholic. Chores may have piled up around the house that desperately need to be done. You may want to go through them like wildfire. You don't have to do them all at once. Take care of the most pressing tasks and then relax. The rest can wait. Ask family members to help.
 ----- 
 Frustration may be the word for today, Sagittarius. You could be experiencing a bit of wanderlust. Distant states and foreign lands may beckon to you, but circumstances could make it hard for you to get away. There might also be friction with your partner. Don't get sucked into a quarrel. Use your placid nature to get grounded, then use your practicality to solve the issues at hand.
 ----- 
 You've probably had a busy week, Capricorn, and may feel out of sorts today. Perhaps you had too much good food last night, stayed up too late, or both. It goes against your grain to stay in and rest, but this is the perfect day to curl up with a good book. You're going to want some exercise, but don't overdo it. As you well know, you can get too much of a good thing!
 ----- 
 There might be a lot of work to do at home today. Since certain family members are conveniently absent, you may feel that the burden falls on you. Don't be a martyr, however. Just do what you can and leave the rest. Uncertainties about money could also be on your mind but put these aside for now. You'll be better able to deal with them tomorrow.
 ----- 
 Too much indulging may leave you with a headache or stomachache to the point where you may want to spend most of today sleeping. The stress of this condition could cause you to snap at family members but remember that they weren't the ones who chose to overindulge. Chill out, get some rest, and regain your strength. You'll be back in the real world soon enough.
 ----- 
 There's an adventurous side to today that you should latch onto. Try not to get weighed down by the little things in your life that don't really matter much. Look at the big picture and understand the importance of having great breadth of vision. There's a whole world to explore out there, Aries, so get going. There may be a few surprises today, so be ready for anything.
 ----- 
 Unexpected people and events are likely to crop up today just as you're longing for adventure. Feel free to hop aboard a train to an unknown destination, Taurus. It's better to regret the things you've done than regret the things you haven't done. Take this to heart as you plan your day. There's no shortage of fun out there 
 ----- 
 It's extremely important that you not be too possessive today, especially when it comes to other people, Gemini. You have important relationships with the people around you, and you'll find that in order to maintain them, it's best to let those people live their lives the way they want. Don't think that people belong to you, because they don't.
 ----- 
 Matters regarding love and romance are in your favor today, Cancer. You'll find that love comes to you when you least expect it. There's a powerful creative force within you that will be most rewarding if you put it to use for some sort of artistic endeavor. A strong yet erratic urge may call you into action, so be ready to respond with your entire being.
 ----- 
 Realize that you might have to leave some things to chance today, because you probably aren't going to be able to control all that you'd like to under the circumstances, Leo. Although it may be comfortable for you to try to fit things into their perfect spots, you'll find that this may not be the best way to conduct your business, especially on a day like this.
 ----- 
 Things should be going quite well for you today, Virgo, especially in the love and romance department. You'll find that there is a magical, adventuresome spirit when you connect with others. Take advantage of this courageous energy and put it to good use in whatever way you see fit. Bring an extra element of excitement into your world tonight with someone very special to you.
 ----- 
 Express your independence today, Libra, and prove to others that you won't be pushed around anymore. Do things for yourself and have fun while you do it. Your heart will know which way is the right way to proceed. Don't be fooled by those who try to tell you otherwise. Success comes when you can initiate others into your world instead of you being seduced by theirs.
 ----- 
 Things relating to love and romance are in your favor today, Scorpio, although you may find that issues of this nature might be unpredictable. Lovers could be present one moment and MIA the next, but these are the risks you take when you deal with love. Find a balance that doesn't get you so wrapped up in someone else that you're hurt if his or her eyes turn elsewhere.
 ----- 
 It might feel like there's a hole in your heart today, Sagittarius, and you could have a hard time filling it. Remember that you're the one responsible for making sure this void is taken care of. If you insist that someone else fill the gap, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Do something nice for yourself and feel free to spend a little money to make yourself happy.
 ----- 
 Issues regarding love and romance are at a climactic point right now, Capricorn, and you could be rather combative. Your energy in this area may come in waves, and you're likely to be so charged up about the situation that you feel like a time bomb ready to explode. Don't destroy something wonderful by wanting a great deal more than you really need.
 ----- 
 Don't expect a great deal of sensitivity from others when it comes to issues concerning love and beauty today, Aquarius. People are apt to be in their own little worlds. It may be hard for you to relate to them now. Trying to sway others to your point of view could be possible, but it may be quite difficult and, more importantly, not worth the effort.
 ----- 
 There could be people who try to convince you that you're wrong about something, Pisces. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you're inferior just because you don't agree with someone on an issue. Focus on your creativity today. You can combine your incredible artistic talent with pure intellectual genius for a dynamite swing that will knock any ball clear out of the park.
 ----- 
 Perhaps you've been planning a trip or a return to school for a long time. However, Aries, a rather disturbing letter or phone call could jeopardize your plans and leave you teetering on the edge of disappointment. If you look at the situation carefully, you may find that it doesn't set you back that much. You can take care of it without sacrificing what you want.
 ----- 
 Seemingly bad news about your financial situation could throw your usually even
 ----- 
 An unpleasant situation could arise. Your first reaction may be to protect those closest to you from the truth. You could be tempted to lie or at least avoid mentioning the situation. Don't give in to the temptation, Gemini. Your desire to shield loved ones is understandable, but it could cause problems. You can't protect people from everything. Most people prefer to know the facts.
 ----- 
 Your mind may be going a thousand miles an hour today. You might be inundated with new ideas and information that could cause mental overload. Write it all down if you can. You'll want to refer to it later. It might be advisable to then go out for a walk or other exercise. This intellectual overload could produce excess nervous energy that you'll need to work off.
 ----- 
 Worries over the situation of a lover or close friend who seems depressed could plague you today, yet you may hesitate to contact this person and ask what's wrong because you don't want to intrude. Nonetheless, you should. All is not as bad as it seems, and your concern will be appreciated. Tonight, get some much
 ----- 
 A family member may be depressed and not up for talking about what's wrong. His or her mood could spread to everyone else, so it might be a good idea to ask what's wrong. Point out that moods are contagious! Don't force the issue, Virgo. That would be worse. A number of calls could interrupt your work, which you might find irritating. Don't be afraid to let voicemail get the calls.
 ----- 
 Misinformation might spread through your extended family or neighborhood and cause unnecessary upsets among those involved. Don't accept at face value any gossip or rumor you hear today until you check it out yourself, Libra. It could turn out to be a tempest in a teapot. This isn't a good time to plan or take a trip of any kind. Delays or mishaps could result.
 ----- 
 Misinformation regarding money could come from someone who has a stake in your believing whatever you're told. This could be a banker, creditor, investment counselor, or even a close friend or relative. Whoever it is, Scorpio, don't accept what this person says at face value. Look into the facts of the situation yourself before making any decisions about what you need to do.
 ----- 
 Someone close to you may not be totally honest. This person could be avoiding telling the truth or hiding something from you in order to protect you. Trust your instincts, Sagittarius. If someone tells you something important that doesn't ring true, check it out before accepting one person's word. This isn't a vicious deception 
 ----- 
 Weariness may have you feeling a bit listless today, Capricorn, and you're likely to want to stay home in bed rather than go anywhere. This goes against your normal inclination, so you could be tempted to bite the bullet and get out in spite of your malaise. Don't fall into this trap. Get some rest so that when you absolutely have to go out, you'll be your old self again.
 ----- 
 A lover or close friend may seem to have dropped out of the picture, and this could have you worried, confused, and wondering if this person isn't interested in continuing a relationship with you. Don't let your insecurity get the best of you. The person has his or her troubles and will eventually want a strong, sympathetic shoulder to cry on. You're likely to be that person!
 ----- 
 Career interests may be short
 ----- 
 Today is a good day to ask for a raise or consider other ways to increase your income, Aries. Superiors will be in a receptive mood and likely feeling more benevolent than usual. This is a good time to study and consider investment possibilities, but it isn't a good time to make investments. The facts may differ from what you read or hear. Wait about a week before deciding.
 ----- 
 You should be feeling especially romantic and sensual now, Taurus, and you might draw admiring glances from those around you 
 ----- 
 Strange, passionate stirrings could find you wanting to escape from civilization with a lover, Gemini. This is a great day for it. At least plan a quiet evening at home with your special someone. You might also want to satisfy other sensual cravings, such as a desire for delicious food, drink, or comfortable chairs or beds. Flow with it. We all need a little self
 ----- 
 Interesting communications from friends could center on possible world developments or maybe some juicy gossip about people you know, Cancer. Enjoy yourself, but don't take everything you hear at face value. Much of it is less actual fact than the product of someone's fertile imagination. Short journeys in your area could bring news of upcoming changes in your community. Expect the unexpected!
 ----- 
 Today you might earn corporate kudos, Leo, for all signs indicate that your imagination is flying high and can be put to work to increase your job effectiveness. You might even earn a promotion or increase in salary. However, it's important to curb the impulse to hide the downside of whatever you're doing from those in power. Be honest! It will benefit you more in the long run.
 ----- 
 Your mind is likely to be going a thousand miles an hour. Ideas for imaginative and innovative projects may come faster than you can possibly turn them into reality. Write them down. You may not have time to work on them now, but you will later. You could decide to attend a virtual lecture, sign up for an online class, or make plans to join friends and attend another kind of small group activity, if possible.
 ----- 
 You may have strange dreams and vivid premonitions today, Libra. Your intuition and telepathic faculties are operating at a high level. You could think of someone who later phones. There's also a tendency to be too paranoid. Don't panic if some of the messages you receive seem disturbing. Check out the facts first. You're likely to find that all is better than you thought
 ----- 
 Today you could be feeling warm and friendly toward everyone. You might be involved in virtual social events or receive invitations to future parties. You'll probably have a great time and make some new friends. Take care to take lots of vitamin C. There could be colds or other bugs flying around and you could be more susceptible to such infections at this time.
 ----- 
 Relations with people on the job should be warm, Sagittarius, and this could do wonders for your career. Take nothing at face value. All may not be as it seems. Someone has issues with you that render him or her untrustworthy. Take care to avoid getting too close to anyone who seems a little under the weather. Your immune system is a bit weak, and you could catch a bug.
 ----- 
 Some new information could come your way that causes you to focus on a new interest, Capricorn. It'll set your mind traveling to faraway places and times. You may also communicate with some new people who are highly educated, from foreign lands, or both. They might have fascinating stories to tell! Whatever happens, today promises to excite your curiosity and stimulate your intellect.
 ----- 
 You could have some intense dreams tonight, Aquarius. You might find that they bring inspiration for creative projects, perhaps for redecorating or otherwise beautifying your home. You could feel energetic now and want to charge ahead and work on your project until you drop. Take care to pace yourself. You might tire to the point of feeling ill.
 ----- 
 A welcome communication from a business or romantic partner could arrive today, Pisces. This could generate a lot of enthusiasm on both your parts and do wonders for your relationship or for whatever business you do together. Be honest with your partner. Don't conceal your concerns. It's better to get things out in the open. Don't worry. Everything will be OK!
 ----- 
 Aries, a long
 ----- 
 Projects that you've worked on in the past may finally bear fruit today, Taurus. Financial benefits and career advancement are strongly indicated, and you be basking in the glow of success. Don't bask too long, however. This is only the beginning! You're on a roll. Throw yourself into new projects you enjoy and you're likely to continue in this fortuitous manner for a while.
 ----- 
 Today your desire for sex and romance is going to receive a powerful surge, Gemini. Perhaps memories of past partners will come back to haunt you, or maybe a current love interest will look especially sexy now. You're likely to be projecting glamour and sensuality, so don't be surprised if strangers notice you. Plan a romantic encounter for tonight, and dress for the occasion.
 ----- 
 You're spiritually inclined, Cancer, and today you could feel especially so. You might be attracted to online meditation groups or the study of the texts of various religions. You're also likely to feel especially psychic, and you might experience some premonitions that actually come true. This is a good time to train your psychic abilities or try reading runes or tarot cards.
 ----- 
 If you happen to be thinking about a particular friend today, Leo, don't be surprised if you hear from him or her. You're especially attuned to telepathic messages, and you may send out a few. While you usually enjoy solitude, you might be more interested in communicating with others today. Don't fight the urge. Go for it. You could talk to some interesting new people who become your friends for life.
 ----- 
 Sudden and unexpected changes could have you feeling a bit confused, disoriented, and doubtful about the future, Virgo. Relax! The changes may be not only beneficial for your career but also for your finances. Don't think those in authority haven't noticed your skills and ingenuity. In fact, you may receive some sincere compliments and gratitude.
 ----- 
 You should wake up feeling hopeful and optimistic about the future, Libra. Your self
 ----- 
 Today, Scorpio, you might turn to practices like meditation or psychic development. Some vivid dreams over the past few days may have brought up personal issues that you need to clear up in order to progress. You may pick up on the thoughts and feelings of others more strongly than usual. If you've been thinking about learning to read tarot cards or runes, this is the day to start.
 ----- 
 A new romance may be in store today, Sagittarius, perhaps with someone you've known for a long time, but you suddenly view in a new light. You could see a side of this person that you've never seen before, totally changing your perception of him or her. Any new relationship formed today shows a lot of promise of developing into a lifelong connection. The bonds involved will run deep.
 ----- 
 You could be in a fanciful mood all day, Capricorn, so you may not be too focused on this world. This is great for artistic or metaphysical studies, as well as being sensitive to others. Beware of a tendency to daydream when you should pay attention! You might want to break out of the mundane world and follow your dreams, but this isn't the day to do it. It's a good day to plan.
 ----- 
 You're intuitive by nature, Aquarius, and today you could almost be clairvoyant. Obey your instincts today. Don't let your rational mind get in the way. This isn't the day to be logical! You can sense the needs of others, so you could earn some gratitude by giving them what they need without being asked. Romantic relationships should be warm, loving, and intimate.
 ----- 
 Creative inspiration could come from either your own past or from history, Pisces. You might want to try painting, music, or poetry, but today it's more likely that you'll turn that inspiration toward your home. If you're planning to refurnish or redecorate, this is the day to start. Your taste and aesthetic sense are operating at a high level.
 ----- 
 There may be some tension today as you try to stabilize your emotions, Aries. There could be a force at work out there that's rather impersonal and detached. More than likely, this force doesn't relate as much to how you feel as it does to how well you've done the job. Stick to your tasks in a practical, grounded manner.
 ----- 
 The tricky things to balance today are your emotions and sense of duty, Taurus. Try not to let the stress of having to complete a task leak into your state of mind. The problem is that your emotions may be running away more quickly than you can handle. Meanwhile, there's a bit of a slowdown when it comes to your sense of duty and responsibility.
 ----- 
 There's a practical grounding today that may cramp your style, Gemini. More than likely you'll be aware of the time restrictions that point up your own limits. Maybe you aren't being realistic about certain areas of your life. These things will become clear today as things progress. Push through this blockage. You'll be a much stronger person once you've moved past this point.
 ----- 
 Your mood should be good today, Cancer, although you should be careful not to rub it in others' faces. If people don't feel like being cheerful, don't force it on them. An important sense of duty is prominent and should be obeyed at all costs. Give your adventurous nature some sort of practical grounding that you can use to be more effective regarding whatever it is you do.
 ----- 
 It isn't a good idea to talk behind other people's backs today, Leo. If you have an issue with someone in particular, bring it up to that person directly. This isn't a good time to gossip. Maintaining trust is extremely important right now. This attitude will open many doors for you. Believe that the more you love others, the more love will be returned to you.
 ----- 
 Put some of your fantastic ideas to good use today, Virgo. It's one thing to be a genius with plenty of masterpieces floating around in your head. It's quite another to actually put things into motion. You may be full of talk, but today it's important to be full of action. Restriction and limitation are creeping in, so do what you can to get things in place before it's too late.
 ----- 
 This is a good day to follow through on projects, Libra. Leaving many unfinished matters in your life only creates clutter that keeps other things from entering the picture. Either dismiss the project entirely or finish it and move on to something else. Don't leave things hanging, including people. Tell others what's going on and you'll be more successful in the long run.
 ----- 
 There could be some restrictions on your emotions today, Scorpio. You'll find that a practical, grounded force is working against your intuitive understanding of whatever issue concerns you. Do your best to anchor yourself in the truth before you scatter seeds of erratic emotions all over the place. It's important for you to maintain stability at all times.
 ----- 
 Feel free to take care of any restructuring in your life that needs to be done now, Sagittarius. Change may be a bit scary at first, but realize that it's a necessary variable in order to make progress. You may not have to change your focus or destination too much, but it's possible that you'll need to adjust your course to get there.
 ----- 
 Your mood may be a bit detached and scattered today, Capricorn. This attitude could get you into trouble if you aren't careful. Make sure you keep at least one foot on the ground. It's important to stay strongly connected with reality or you could find yourself up a creek without a paddle. Feel free to get more deeply involved in a project that you might otherwise leave to others.
 ----- 
 Seek the counsel of someone older and wiser today, Aquarius. Whether you want to or not, you may encounter someone with authority who's likely to tell you what he or she thinks. Heed the advice that comes from others. There is a whole other perspective out there that you need to consider in order to bring things back to equilibrium.
 ----- 
 Flamboyant shows of emotions may not be as welcome as usual today, Pisces. Realize that you may need to put a damper on things in order to earn the respect of the people around you. Tone it down and understand the importance of grounding and stability. Strong forces could bring you down to this level whether you want them to or not, so why bother trying to resist?
 ----- 
 You could get upsetting news regarding your job, Aries. There could be a shakeup in the hierarchy or someone in a position of authority could abruptly leave. You and your co
 ----- 
 Expect to fall in love at first sight today, Taurus. Someone new will come on the scene and you'll feel an instant attraction. Whether it turns into anything lasting or not isn't certain, but whatever happens, you'll remember this person for a long time! You may also have a sudden interest in new forms of artistic expression and want to start learning videography or computer graphics.
 ----- 
 The wonders of technology may come to your home today, Gemini. You might purchase some new equipment like a computer or phone, or decide to go for a state
 ----- 
 Valuable and interesting information could come your way through modern technology. You might discover new information online that awakens an exciting new interest in you, perhaps related to the sciences, occult, or metaphysics. You could even discover a talent for astrology. Online group activities may also be appealing now, particularly those regarding humanitarian pursuits.
 ----- 
 Finances could take on a new dimension as you look to technology to help you increase your bank balance. You could decide to invest online or try some new means of recordkeeping. Whatever you try will bode well for your financial future. Expect a lucky break or two as well.
 ----- 
 Bizarre, unexpected developments might turn your life upside down today, Virgo. Money could be involved. New people could arrive who open doors that eventually lead to a new life. You could even fall in love at first sight. It isn't easy to make predictions for a strange day like this. Rest assured that when you go to bed you won't be the same person you were when you woke up.
 ----- 
 Today you might be fascinated with movies, music, and video. You could discover a new interest in filmmaking, sound engineering, or videography that you want to pursue. You might decide to read about these fields and apply what you learn to the movies you see and the music you hear. If you're serious about learning these skills, this is the time to go for it. You'll enjoy it!
 ----- 
 You could have a strong urge to seek adventure, Scorpio. You might want to take a spontaneous trip to an exotic place, meet new people in exciting fields, or try new pastimes, perhaps as outrageous as skydiving. Go for it if you are able, but this urge could indicate boredom in some part of your life. What can you change about your lifestyle to avoid future stagnation?
 ----- 
 An unexpected career break could come your way, Sagittarius. It should be exciting and encouraging 
 ----- 
 A trip by air may be in your future, Capricorn. You may be planning to tour distant states or foreign lands when thats possible. You could be going with friends or a group you're associated with. Unusual new interests could capture your attention, enticing you to further study. You might enroll in an online workshop. You're looking toward expanding your horizons. Take care not to spread yourself too thin.
 ----- 
 Unusual experiences may give rise to a new interest in the sciences or occult practices like magic or alchemy. This is an excellent time to start perusing such subjects, Aquarius, or embark on a formal study of astrology. A lucky money break could come your way today. It might be a gift or a repaid loan. Your inclination might be to go out and spend it all. Take care!
 ----- 
 Upsets in the home or neighborhood could lead to a sudden decision to move, causing a great deal of activity. You might not yet be sure where you're going. Organization and discipline are vital at times like this, Pisces. It might be helpful to make lists and cross off each task as you finish it. Don't panic. This could turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you.
 ----- 
 This should be a fortunate day for you, Aries. Everything you try to do should go fairly smoothly. Relations with others are warm, friendly, and congenial. Any chores or other pending work should be completed quickly and efficiently. If you've been planning to start a new project, this is the day to get going. Romance should be intense and passionate now, so make the most of it!
 ----- 
 A couple you've known for a long time could visit you at your home today, Taurus. Don't be surprised if they tell you how wonderful the place looks. Conversation should be lively and entertaining, though you should sidestep any discussion of controversial subjects. Debates on such matters could get rather heated. It might be wise to treat your guests to food rather than alcohol!
 ----- 
 Today, Gemini, you might spend a great deal of time in the car running errands in the neighborhood. You're likely to see people you know who have interesting news. New businesses may open nearby. Doctors, dentists, and other professionals could add virtual consultations, making your daily routine more convenient. Some of them might be your neighbors or relatives.
 ----- 
 Money that you've been earning for a long time may finally come your way today, Cancer, but don't be surprised if you have to do a lot of running around in order to get it. Plans for future moneymaking projects could come up, although it's important to consider everything carefully and not jump in too quickly. This is an excellent time to learn a new moneymaking skill.
 ----- 
 The special someone in your life may be having some trouble with colleagues. Don't just comfort him or her, Leo. It's unlikely that your sweetie wants sympathy. Solutions are needed. If you don't have any, just be a good listener. It's important for you to get out and exercise. If the weather is good, take a walk. If not, attend an online exercise class. You'll feel better.
 ----- 
 Today you're likely to be working hard behind the scenes, perhaps preparing a project for others to make public or coaching people for some kind of virtual performance. You'll expend a lot of energy in the course of completing this chore, yet you'll probably feel it was all worth it. Don't expect to go home early, Virgo. You'll probably go above and beyond the call of duty.
 ----- 
 Friends could entice you to join them for a short day trip, perhaps to the country. This is a great day to go on such an outing if its possible, Libra. You've probably been working hard and need to get away for a while. Don't be surprised if there's a delay, however. You or one of your friends could be waiting to talk with someone.
 ----- 
 Emotions could be intense at work today as important projects approach their deadlines, Scorpio. You may put in more time than usual. Tempers might flare and co
 ----- 
 Today you should feel especially sexy and relationships with romantic partners should go well, Sagittarius. Your passions are intense, the lines of communication are open, and appreciation of one another is running high. There might be talk of taking a long trip together in the future. Plan a cozy evening for two. You'll want to do a lot of talking 
 ----- 
 Money is probably on your mind now, Capricorn. A desire for increased financial security could force you to look for work or investments that would pay off big. Opportunities for one or both of these are likely to come through friends, perhaps someone with whom you've worked before. You're likely to accomplish what you want for now, but it's uncertain whether you'll continue on this path in the future.
 ----- 
 Don't expect to spend a lot of time at home today, Aquarius. You're more likely to be in the car and away from home. There may be errands and other obligations to fulfill. Try to pace yourself in whatever you do or else you might be exhausted by day's end. Take the time to stop and enjoy yourself. This will ensure a fun rather than tiring day.
 ----- 
 Emotional turmoil on the job could stress you out way too much. Headaches or temporary hypertension could plague you if you aren't careful. Don't push too hard. Remember to take breaks, Pisces, and go for a walk on your lunch hour. Don't be afraid to put off nonessential tasks. You'll be all right. Why make a day's work any more difficult than it needs to be?
 ----- 
 Your mind may be a little cloudy most of the day, Aries, and you could find it hard to ground yourself. It may be that you're trying to navigate by the stars, but unfortunately, the clouds have moved in and there are no reference points to be seen. The good news is that the skies should clear later, and you'll find there's nothing but smooth sailing for the rest of the night.
 ----- 
 Praise you may receive this morning could make you feel on top of the world, Taurus, but try not to let this feeling go to your head. Stay modest despite the lavish praise that may be showered on you. By evening, you won't be able to get by on just talk alone. Actions will speak much louder than words and it's important that you have some sort of plan.
 ----- 
 Things should improve for you as the day progresses, Gemini. The key is to stay loose and not be concerned with the situation's outcome. The future is uncertain. You shouldn't depend on something that may or may not pan out the way you want. There could be some conflict between you and someone with a strong ego in the morning, but this should resolve itself by evening.
 ----- 
 Your emotions could feel restricted today, Cancer, a feeling that may be difficult to shake. Take this opportunity to calm down and relax. You'll enjoy the good times more when you give your body the rest it needs. Always pushing for bigger and better adventures may be fun, but it can leave you too tired to fully appreciate them.
 ----- 
 It could be hard to find your footing early in the day, Leo. You may be better off sleeping in. Have a good breakfast and relax in the morning. By evening, you'll be refreshed, recharged, and ready to take on the town. Your emotions may feel restricted, which could make it difficult to fully express yourself. You'd be better off turning this energy inward now.
 ----- 
 Use the morning to take care of yourself, Virgo. You could be so concerned with the world and the shared environment that you forget to take care of you. Use the early afternoon to reflect and meditate. Gather facts from your inner state and use the information to create a plan for the future. Be flexible in your approach.
 ----- 
 Get to some water today and reconnect with this element, Libra. Like lapping waves against the shore, you may be gently changing the landscape around you with each word or action. Don't underestimate your inner strength. It could be that you seem overpowered by the things going on around you, but don't let them keep you from being the person you truly are.
 ----- 
 Emotionally speaking, you should be doing quite well today, Scorpio, especially in the morning. This is a good time to take charge of projects that require definite leadership. Don't think that you're inferior to the people around you. Act like you belong in a leadership role and you'll find that others will automatically support you in that position. You have what it takes to lead.
 ----- 
 You may get frustrated today, Sagittarius, especially in the morning when other people's egos seem to be strong. It could be difficult to relate to people who simply refuse to accept any opinion but their own. Things should mellow out by afternoon. You'll find people start to see things from your perspective. Remain confident in your position despite the vacillation of others.
 ----- 
 People may see you as the personification of drama, especially this morning, Capricorn. This is a good time to express your emotions and get things out of your system. Be sure to release whatever pent
 ----- 
 There may be a damper on your mood today, Aquarius, especially in the morning. It could seem as if everyone is having fun but you. Having a good time is more a state of mind than anything else. Try not to get trapped in a lousy mindset. Late afternoon is a good time to ground your emotions. Operate from a point of stability instead of jealousy.
 ----- 
 There may be some conflict today, Pisces, especially in the morning. Your general mood is quite good, but there's a strong force asking you to be more realistic in your approach. The last thing you want is for someone else to throw a bucket of water on your raging fire of fun, but this is likely to happen unless you address the reality of the situation.
 ----- 
 Today you may feel bored and frustrated with your life's direction, Aries. You feel buried under responsibilities, with no time left to do what you really want to do. You have other interests to pursue but no time to pursue them. It's frustrating. You might want to rethink your priorities. If you're creative about time management, you'll be able to find some time.
 ----- 
 You're less optimistic and energetic than usual, Taurus. Your mind feels sluggish 
 ----- 
 You may be discouraged about money matters today, Gemini. Perhaps a raise you'd been hoping for didn't come through. Perhaps a professional project didn't work out as you expected. Now is the time to put your ingenuity to work and figure out a way to earn the money you need. Trust that you have the necessary know
 ----- 
 If work is beginning to feel more like a burden than a joy, it may be time to rethink your job, Cancer. Your personality is such that you need lots of room to stretch and grow. If you feel stifled, you know it's time to find a new professional challenge. You're fortunate that your skill set affords you many opportunities. Choose carefully!
 ----- 
 You're especially in tune with the environment and the people around you today, Leo. Such sensitivity is new to you, and you aren't exactly sure what to do with the myriad messages that come into your head, seemingly out of nowhere. Even though this is outside your usual experience, try to accept rather than analyze.
 ----- 
 You're drawn to public service, Virgo. This desire propels you to volunteer your services with a group of some kind. You may feel a bit awkward at first, but your natural leadership abilities will soon kick in. The group will be left wondering how they ever managed without you. Your talent shines through once again. Well done!
 ----- 
 Don't take everything at face value today, Libra. Information you receive might not be accurate. Someone could be repeating gossip or even creating it just to have something to talk about. Don't take part in the discussion. Since your workload is likely heavy, forego the socializing in favor of finishing the tasks in front of you.
 ----- 
 You may be feeling a bit on edge today, Scorpio. Your self
 ----- 
 You and your mate may be experiencing some differences of opinion. It seems you each have definite ideas about some of life's fundamental values and they aren't completely in sync. Make an extra effort to communicate, Sagittarius. You may find that your values aren't as far apart as they first seemed. This rift between you will soon close. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 It isn't exactly all lightness and harmony at home today, Capricorn. There's tension in the air and it manifests in silly family arguments. Try to arrange separate activities for siblings, and encourage your partner to eat out with friends, if possible. This is a day to give everyone his or her space. Tomorrow everyone will be happy to eat together again.
 ----- 
 This could be a particularly stressful day, Aquarius. Your workload is heavier than ever, thanks to the increased responsibility you've taken on. The day seems endless, yet there aren't enough hours to get done all that needs doing. Take care not to take your anxiety out on others. If you're nice to them, they may even help you finish your project!
 ----- 
 Your self
 ----- 
 It's probably in your nature to want to include everyone in your plans today, Aries. Perhaps you're running around making sure everyone is being cared for. More than likely, your nurturing instinct is coming out, so feel free to spread this love around. Be careful not to sacrifice too much of yourself as you do this.
 ----- 
 You may find that you have a strong will now, Taurus. Once you get fired up to go somewhere, there's little chance that anyone can stop you. People may accuse you of being lazy or wanting to take the easy way out, but it's different this time. You should feel fired up and ready to move. The only thing that could get in the way might be someone's oversensitive emotions.
 ----- 
 Calm down today, Gemini, and be careful about accusing someone of something when you don't have all the facts. Keep your wrath under control. If you strike out now, you may find that you lose their respect forever. There are no guarantees on a day like today. If there are conflicts that you need to work out, at least make sure that it's done in private.
 ----- 
 You may be feeling a bit more in touch with your warrior side than your emotional side today, Cancer. More than likely this will set the stage for conflict in your world of hopes and dreams. Be careful that you aren't too aggressive toward people who are just trying to help you. The danger here is that you're most likely to hurt the ones closest to you. Be careful.
 ----- 
 You may find that someone or something is thinking or working opposite to the way you are, Leo. This feeling is aggravated even more by a strong warrior force that wants to be recognized. There is definitely a squeaky wheel in the situation that desperately needs oiling. Take care of the basics first before you try to deal with the particulars of a certain situation.
 ----- 
 Pay attention to your body today and feel free to stop when your body says to stop, Virgo. There's a strong aggressive force asking you to take action in one way or another. Make sure that you are considerate of others. Most importantly, make sure that you are considerate of yourself. Don't indulge in cheap thrills at the expense of your physical well
 ----- 
 Emotionally, you should be doing well today, Libra. But when it comes to taking action, you're apt to be indecisive. Every option seems to look fantastic. You probably aren't going to want to miss out on anything. The best thing for you to do is try to get a piece of everything. There are many pies to dip your fingers into. Why not taste them all to see which one you like best?
 ----- 
 There's tension in the air today, Scorpio, and you might be restless and anxious to start something. There is plenty of energy around to feed you, but the trick is to make sure that you're doing things for the right reasons. Don't do things out of guilt, fear, or regret. Keep on the best path for the best reasons for the best results.
 ----- 
 You're probably feeling more in touch with your emotions, Sagittarius, but it might be difficult to know which way to move based on where you are. There's an element of aggression in your world today that might aggravate your heart, making it difficult for you to get a grip on your situation. Try to calm down and focus before making any major decisions.
 ----- 
 You may be focused on a certain trajectory, Capricorn, but today you could run into complications based on overlooked issues. Be aware of the people around you and how your actions affect them. You don't necessarily need to change your direction, but you might need to make a couple modifications along the way in order to keep everyone happy.
 ----- 
 You should be in a good mood today, Aquarius, but don't be surprised if some aggravating force steps on your toes or pulls your chain in some way. More than likely, there isn't much you can do about the situation except grin and bear it. Do your best to maintain your position and don't lose self
 ----- 
 Your aggressive nature is strong today, so be careful, Pisces. Even though this may be good for getting things done and tackling any project you need to complete, the problem is that you might tend to step on other people's toes in the process. Be considerate of others' emotions and try not to get upset if someone else takes the spotlight for a while.
 ----- 
 It youre able to attend a social event today, Aries, you won't feel like talking. You could be content just to listen to what everyone else says, feel at peace, and enjoy the warmth, music, and company. You may have been spending too much time at home and could well need to get out for a while. Relax, sit back in your chair, and enjoy yourself!
 ----- 
 Someone, perhaps a close friend or partner, could present you with a small gift today, Taurus, possibly a book. There might not be any special occasion other than your friend thought you'd enjoy it. This can bring up warm and affectionate feelings. You'll want to spend a considerable amount of time with this person. You may think it's rare to find someone so sensitive and kind.
 ----- 
 Your intuition should be keener than usual today, Gemini, but right now you're apt to be more interested in historical figures, perhaps people associated with spiritual disciplines. Books on these subjects could not only be interesting but also informative. Insights you gain from reading about these people help increase your understanding of the present. Keep reading!
 ----- 
 Happiness reigns in the home, Cancer, as everyone seems to have reached a new understanding of one another. You could also experience a new sense of peace and quiet. Everyone is concentrating more on reading and working on their own projects and less on socializing. This could be a wonderful time for you. You're getting along with your family and the house is a peaceful haven. Enjoy!
 ----- 
 Today you might attend a virtual group event of some kind involving your neighborhood, Leo, possibly with a partner. You and your friend might take an active part in discussing goals for the group. You feel strongly bonded to everyone 
 ----- 
 Circumstances are changing regarding your professional goals, Virgo. You may have been thinking about a change for a long time, but someone you meet today, perhaps in a social or casual situation, could provide the motivation you need to finally decide. This isn't just the result of outer changes. You've been changing inside, too. You aren't the same person you were when you chose your current job.
 ----- 
 You're probably good at applying your spiritual principles to the way you live, Libra. You're especially good at it today, particularly when it comes to understanding others deeply. Relationships of all kinds will likely grow and improve, at least those that matter. Those that don't will disappear. This is a time of great outer and inner change for you. Make the most of it!
 ----- 
 Scorpio, you're usually more outwardly directed, but today you might break that pattern. You could be in a contemplative mood and wondering about everything from metaphysics to philosophy to money to your future. You're basically feeling positive about life, but you might be at a crossroads now. It may take some serious thought before you decide which direction to go. Give yourself some time.
 ----- 
 Today you might crave the companionship of friends and lovers alike, Sagittarius. You're probably in the mood for some good food, good music, and great conversation, and that's just what you'll get if its possible in any way. Later you might spend time alone with a love partner, reflecting on recent conversations. Some of them might be worthy of deeper thought. Have a pleasant day and a wonderful evening.
 ----- 
 You're feeling pretty strong now, Capricorn. You're probably in fairly good health and your mind is sharp. You've outgrown some areas of your life that no longer seem what they once were. One of these could be your work. You could be considering leaving a job you took primarily for the money and going into a profession you really love. Do it if it works for you.
 ----- 
 Are you getting along better than ever with a significant other, Aquarius? If so, it's probably because you're more attuned to what your partner thinks, feels, needs, and wants. You might fetch something before he or she even knows it's necessary. This can help you reach a new understanding of your beloved. Go with the flow and make the most of it. You'll be glad you did.
 ----- 
 Peace reigns in the home today. Members of your household could communicate with each other almost telepathically, Pisces. You might find it strange, but it shouldn't be surprising. After all, they've been living together for a while! It's good for peace in the home. They can sense and avoid whatever irritates someone else. That should give you some welcome breathing space.
 ----- 
 Travel of any kind might be virtually impossible today, Aries. Airports could be jammed, flights delayed, and planes plagued with mechanical problems. If you're traveling by car, expect road construction and backed
 ----- 
 This isn't a good day to invest in anything. Don't spend much time working on speculative projects, Taurus, and don't put your money into anything but gold, land, or blue
 ----- 
 A love partner could be gloomy today, Gemini. This might be the kind of day when no matter how many times you draw your mate's attention to the doughnut, he or she still sees only the hole. The glass is always half empty, never half full. Your beloved will probably be this way all day. Don't let it drive you crazy. Try to see the humor in it. That will help you, anyway.
 ----- 
 You tend to be curious, Cancer, and you're always trying to learn more about your many interests. But today you could be eager to research a subject but be unable to find any information about it no matter how many libraries or databases you explore. Don't bother with it today. You'll only get frustrated. Watch some television. At least you'll get a few laughs.
 ----- 
 The need to attend to business or networking obligations disguised as parties could get to you today, Leo. You may have been forced to attend too many of these recently, and now there are even more coming up. You dread going to a place you don't want to go, eating food you hate, talking pleasantly with people you can't stand. Decline if you can. Life's too short.
 ----- 
 Your home could be empty today, Virgo. Other household members may be away and you could find it depressing. Instead of enjoying the solitude, you could feel like the walls are closing in around you. The only answer is to go out for a while. Take a walk or visit some bookstores or antique shops, if possible. Don't go home until you're too tired to do anything else. Try to have fun.
 ----- 
 Someone close to you might be uncharacteristically silent today, Libra. Something is bothering them terribly, and they don't seem to want to talk about it. You're willing to listen or help, but don't try to coax your friend into sharing. Use your intuition to sense what's going on and do what you can to alleviate the situation. Your efforts won't go unnoticed or unappreciated.
 ----- 
 Financial worries might come up today, Scorpio. You may check your bank balance and find that you have little money. This might come as a shock, because you thought there was plenty there. Before you panic, ask whoever's in charge at the bank to double
 ----- 
 Today you might be so gloomy that you don't even want to get up. It might not be a good idea to stay home, however. Try to find some tasks to distract you. At some point during the day, get out in the open air and take a walk, preferably through a park and near water, if possible. You'll get the endorphins going and lift your spirits considerably.
 ----- 
 Any work today could require a higher level of concentration than you can muster, Capricorn. You might lapse into daydreams, think about personal matters, and feel guilty because you aren't doing what you're supposed to be doing. On days like this it's best to focus on routine tasks you can do automatically. That way, your mind can wander. That's the only way you'll make it through today.
 ----- 
 Today your creative impulses could seem blocked, Aquarius. You might be trying to reach your own or someone else's deadline. You may feel the need to get some work done, while your muse seems to have gone on vacation. If your deadline is official, phone whoever's in charge and ask for an extension. You won't be happy with the results if you force yourself to work today.
 ----- 
 A friend who planned to stop by tonight might not show up, Pisces. You may worry since this person isn't one to blow you off. Don't imagine accidents or disasters. The culprit's probably traffic. Phone your friend. If you don't reach him or her, leave a message to call you. Your friend is probably fine, but you may have to postpone your visit for another day.
 ----- 
 All things domestic are highlighted, Aries. It could be that you've finally called the plumber or set out to do those household repairs yourself. New people are likely to come into your life. In fact, they may try to finagle an invitation for dinner, if possible. All you can expect today is the unexpected. Have some extra food on hand and see what happens.
 ----- 
 Keep your mind open to any and all possibilities today, Taurus. It's likely that you'll encounter someone who imparts valuable information. You may not realize right away just how important this information is, but it could have a dramatic impact on your life. Be prepared for anything. This is likely to be a most interesting day.
 ----- 
 Your ship could come in today, Gemini. It will happen unexpectedly, and it may take you some time to adjust to this sudden financial windfall. This is a day of big changes, because you may also decide to use this money to completely alter your way of life. It could be that you make a move to another part of the country or decide to change professions. Trust your instincts, Gemini.
 ----- 
 You're likely aware of your writing abilities, Cancer, but you may not realize the extent of your talent. It would be worthwhile to devote more time to your craft. You can't improve much if writing time is interrupted by other obligations. Take some time to produce something of value. Why not give it a try, even if just for a week or so, to see what you can do?
 ----- 
 Tact isn't necessarily your strong suit, Leo. No one would accuse you of being overly sensitive to other people's emotions, but today you turn over a new leaf. This "new and improved" you tunes in to the thoughts and feelings of others and responds in thoughtful, caring ways. You may be surprised at how effective this gentler touch can be.
 ----- 
 Even though you probably aren't getting on a plane today, Virgo, you would love to at some point in the future. Your wanderlust is back and you're bound for the wild blue yonder yet again, most likely to someplace exotic. Enjoy the time away, but do come back. It seems that sometimes your spirit of adventure dampens your enjoyment of the more mundane but more real daily life.
 ----- 
 Positive change rarely happens without effort. Keep this in mind as transformation occurs quickly. You may feel as though you're in the middle of a whirlpool and getting sucked deeper and deeper, unsure of where you'll ultimately end up. This is merely the "nose to the grindstone" phase. Trust that your efforts will ultimately be rewarded.
 ----- 
 You have natural leadership abilities, and today would be an ideal day to make use of this talent. In the past you may have hesitated to step forward and implement your ideas. But recent successes have given you the necessary confidence to pursue your objectives. You'll likely find that the higher
 ----- 
 Today you feel in control and on top of the world. You can do anything, Sagittarius. This would be an auspicious time to begin a new project or creative endeavor. You can't help but succeed but take care not to get in your own way. Sometimes you can be your own worst enemy. Believe in yourself and move confidently in the direction of your dreams in order to make them come true.
 ----- 
 Friendship could turn into romance if you aren't careful, Capricorn. A platonic relationship could turn passionate, and no one would be more surprised than you. Think carefully about where you'd like this to go. While it can't go back to the way it was, you can stop it from progressing further if you're uncomfortable with the new dynamic. You can only make this decision once.
 ----- 
 Today you wake up feeling reinvigorated and renewed, Aquarius. You feel as though you can accomplish anything. And very likely, today you can. Anything you set your mind and attention to works out beautifully. Take care that you don't gloat too much, though. Just because you feel invincible doesn't necessarily mean that you are.
 ----- 
 People often see you as shy and reserved, Pisces, but of course you know that you're really very friendly once you relax. Today you find it unusually easy to interact with others. In fact, you feel downright gregarious as you chat and joke along with the best of them. This new, sociable you does wonders for your image. You've needed to loosen up for some time.
 ----- 
 The key for you today is to not take things too seriously, Aries. You'll find that the more you deliberate over a decision, the harder it will be for you to make. You may miss your opportunity while you're weighing the facts. Be spontaneous. Try something you've never tried before. Vary your experiences so things don't get boring. Variety is the spice of life.
 ----- 
 This is a terrific day for you, Taurus, and you'll find that long
 ----- 
 It may be necessary to hire a translator in order to get through to people today, Gemini. You may find that the more adamant you become, the more people shut you out. Keep things light and energetic. Too serious a tone could lead to disaster. Try not to make things more complicated than they need to be. You're holding the right cards, and now it's time to play them strategically.
 ----- 
 A great deal of wind fills your sails today, Cancer, so set your course for a long
 ----- 
 There's a lighthearted, whimsical quality about the day that you might not appreciate at first, Leo. You'll find that the more open and accepting you are of this energy, the more you can make it work positively for you. Use this feeling to balance the seriousness in your day. Don't get caught up in unnecessary drama that has nothing to do with your situation.
 ----- 
 You can probably sweet
 ----- 
 Find comfort in the people around you today, Libra. Try not to take things too seriously. Don't feel like you need to internalize everyone else's problems. Take a step back from any situation that doesn't seem right to you. You may find conversation with new people to be extremely stimulating and rewarding. Keep your guard up, but don't let it block you from new experiences.
 ----- 
 Someone has just turned the fan up high, Scorpio. There's no lack of air to fuel your fire. Information is flying left and right and there's a lot of opportunity associated with it. To take advantage of this powerful day, keep the air circulating around you. Stretch and take deep, powerful breaths to enhance your nervous system and make the best use of this energy.
 ----- 
 The time has come for you to be more flexible in your approach, Sagittarius. Things are changing quickly, and if you aren't prepared to change with them, you'll be left behind. Be aware of the fluctuating atmosphere around you and be prepared to make the necessary internal adjustments that help you fit in better with the external environment. Don't fear change.
 ----- 
 This is a wonderful day for you, Capricorn. You'll find that you're holding all the cards you need to be successful. Today luck and prosperity meet with discipline to create a perfect situation for wealth. Your preparation is finally paying off. You'll find that the more in tune you can be with yourself, the better integrated you'll be with the people around you.
 ----- 
 Things will be extremely light and airy today, Aquarius. You may find that people are a bit less sensitive than you. Moving out of your comfort zone is the key to growth. Don't hesitate to move into the unknown. You can achieve a greater sense of balance between yourself and your environment if you're open to change and accept it.
 ----- 
 The wind is blowing briskly today, Pisces, helping you keep your internal fire burning bright. You'll be a social butterfly today. Your energy may be scattered, but this can actually work to your advantage. Picking up tidbits of information and hints from different places and people will help you integrate your energy with your environment. Capitalize on this exciting energy.
 ----- 
 You may run into a great deal of frustration if you try to fight the current circumstances, Aries. The key is to take whatever situation you're in and make the best of it. Whining and moping about your position won't make things better. You have great gifts to be proud of and thankful for, so don't throw them away by thinking that they have no outlet. Create your own reality.
 ----- 
 Keeping things in balance today might be tricky, Taurus, since your instincts may gravitate toward a loving, fanciful, peaceful situation. There's a harsh, warring force working against this position. Beware of this powerful energy that's self
 ----- 
 Things may be tough and aggressive today, Gemini, but that doesn't mean you can't make progress. There's a nervous energy in the air spurring people to action. Keep in mind that you're likely to get caught up in the frenzy and be called to take a stand. Be careful that your viewpoint doesn't become fixed and stubborn. You can learn some valuable lessons by listening to others.
 ----- 
 Make sure that the battle you fight today is yours, Cancer. There's a great deal of tension in the air that might erupt when you least expect it. It may behoove you to stay detached from the war that's apt to ensue. Keep things light and try not to take things too seriously. Your philosophical viewpoint and strong spirit are the very combination needed to resolve the situation.
 ----- 
 Wake up on the right side of bed, Leo. This will set the tone for the rest of the day. Keep things positive and you'll find that the aggressive energies of the day work for instead of against you. Don't try to fight people who are so obstinate that they refuse to see another perspective. At the same time, make sure you stay open to other people's points of view.
 ----- 
 You may feel a strong connection with your fanciful, romantic side today, Virgo. Dreams and illusions are apt to enter the scene and take you into the clouds. Be careful, because you might find that a strong aggressive force opposes these dreams. Your wit and connection with new technology and electrical gadgets will be your greatest assets on a day like today.
 ----- 
 Give people the benefit of the doubt today, Libra. Even though you may not agree with everything going on around you, people have their reasons for the way they act and the way they are. This doesn't mean that you need to act in exactly the same manner. Stick to your routine and don't get thrown off track by the aggressive warrior in others.
 ----- 
 Some action you took yesterday may be opposed today, Scorpio. Unclear facts and romantic fantasies could get in the way of your taking decisive action. You may feel the need to act anyway. Keep in mind that communication could be tainted by pockets of uncertainty. Try not to rock the boat. Today's energy is a delicate balance between war and peace.
 ----- 
 If you find yourself in a slump today, Sagittarius, don't worry. It could be that nothing fits right or that a certain nervous, restless energy urges you to take action, but uncertainty prevents you from knowing which way to turn. This combination could result in a locked
 ----- 
 Use the day's boisterous energy to take charge and make things happen, Capricorn. You'll find that actions you take today resonate in the coming days. Don't worry about the consequences. Simply go for the gusto. Strong forces are at work encouraging you to seek freedom in your creative endeavors and giving you more room to explore your inner sanctuary that you hold so dearly.
 ----- 
 There's apt to be powerful aggression today that may leave you feeling like you want to declare war on everyone, Aquarius. You may get the feeling that everyone else is completely nuts and you're the only one who really knows what's going on. Beware of misinformed people and false information. Fights could erupt over facts that seem true at first but are just someone's misguided dreams.
 ----- 
 You may run into some tension today as fantasy gets in the way of your plan of attack, Pisces. Keep in mind that things are moving rapidly these days, and the slightest movement is magnified. Don't try to undo things that can't be undone. Accept your mistakes and move on. There's a whole world for you to explore and conquer, so try not to get trapped in your own little box.
 ----- 
 Today you should be looking especially good and feeling particularly passionate and sensual, Aries. This is a great day to buy new clothes online, as your fashion sense is probably right on target. Racy novels and romantic movies may seem more appealing than usual. This is a great day to be alone with a love partner, if possible. Try to do this early in the day so there won't be any conflicts.
 ----- 
 Your imagination should be flying high today, Taurus. Words, images, melodies, or whatever your artistic media are probably popping into your head faster than you can keep track of them. Write them down, record them, or do whatever you can to remember them or you could very easily forget them. You don't want that to happen. Take time to do this no matter what else is pressing.
 ----- 
 Your financial goals are probably on the verge of becoming reality, Gemini, but it might seem as if the few tasks remaining are too monumental to face right now. Don't fall into gloom and despair. Try to find some workable ideas to get these obstacles out of your way with minimal effort. Remember, there's always a way if you take time to plan. Good luck.
 ----- 
 Conversations with a friend whose good sense you trust could open your eyes to new career possibilities, Cancer. You might think about transforming your working life. These opportunities need careful consideration, since you've never contemplated them before. There's no rush to make up your mind, so don't feel pressured. Do give it some thought. You'll probably be glad you did.
 ----- 
 Strange dreams, insights, or visions could upend your spiritual orientation, Leo. These new ideas could have your mind going a thousand miles an hour and shake up concepts that you've embraced for most of your life. Think about it without making yourself crazy. What you're receiving is nothing more Earthshaking than information to consider and then accept or reject.
 ----- 
 A friend you may not have seen for a while could awaken strange new feelings for which you're unprepared, Virgo. You may see this person as a potential romantic partner. What you do about it depends on your situation. It probably isn't a good idea to pursue this attraction today. It may pass. Wait a few days. If it's still there, who knows?
 ----- 
 The formation of a new business partnership might transform your working life, Libra. The benefits may not appear for a while, so don't quit your day job. Nonetheless, it's definitely worth considering. Make sure you have all the facts before making any formal commitment. It's important to be aware of every possible contingency before you start a new enterprise, especially now.
 ----- 
 Unfinished job tasks might have you wanting to pitch in and get them done no matter what it takes, Scorpio. This is likely to earn you a few brownie points with your colleagues but take care that you don't stress yourself out. You probably woke up feeling pretty good this morning, but you won't finish the day that way if you exhaust yourself. Pace yourself.
 ----- 
 Today you're apt to feel very sensual and passionate, Sagittarius. Sexy clothes, racy novels, and romantic movies could be more appealing than usual. Don't be surprised if you attract admiring glances from strangers. This is an excellent day to schedule an evening alone with a lover, although you might not be able to get together now. You'll enjoy it whenever it happens. Better late than never!
 ----- 
 A powerful desire for a current or potential romantic partner might come over you today, Capricorn. This person could live far away or be on a trip, so you might have to be satisfied with a phone call or email instead of the meeting you'd prefer. Don't get frustrated. Distract yourself with an exciting novel or movie and look forward to when you can get together.
 ----- 
 A powerful need to reach someone either for business or personal reasons could have you spending a lot of time on the phone that may come to nothing, Aquarius. You might call every place this person could possibly be, and this could prove frustrating. Your friend may be away. Leave a message or two and let him or her call you back. Find something else to distract you.
 ----- 
 Money matters could prove obsessive today, Pisces, as you might be trying to make an important purchase and need to revise your budget in order to do so. You'll be able to do it if you calm down and don't stress out. Be logical and methodical, and you'll probably accomplish what you want without too much frustration. Tonight, schedule a special date with a lover, if possible.
 ----- 
 Your intuition is likely to be very keen today, Aries. Accurate psychic insights could come to you thick and fast. Your imagination is also strong, and you might come up with ideas to enrich your home, work, or anything else on your mind. Don't be surprised if you seem to know what others will say before they even think of it. Write down any premonitions to verify later.
 ----- 
 Get
 ----- 
 Today things could be rather hectic at work, Gemini. You'll probably be very busy and happy with whatever results you produce. You could tire yourself out, so be sure to take occasional breaks, and certainly don't forget to eat. Don't be surprised if colleagues pay you a lot of compliments. In the evening, get takeout for dinner and unwind. You deserve it.
 ----- 
 Some new information about an interesting field could have you browsing the web and looking through books to learn more, Cancer. This could involve law, philosophy, history, or spirituality. You could find so much that you want to take notes or make a lot of photocopies. Don't tire yourself out and try to keep track of time. You might miss dinner or get to bed very late.
 ----- 
 Today you might learn about new and creative ways to increase your income, Leo, possibly involving technology in some way. So much new information could come your way that you find it hard to keep track of it, so make sure you take note of where you found it so you can consult the source later. Your mind could be going so fast that you need to take a walk to clear your head.
 ----- 
 Social events could put you in touch with interesting people in intriguing professions, Virgo. You might get involved in some fascinating conversations that provide you with a lot of useful information. Some of what you hear could be so bizarre that you find it difficult to believe. New friendships or groups could result from this interaction, so get contact information. Enjoy!
 ----- 
 A friend or colleague could recommend some books that you want to read right away, Libra. Be sure you take breaks and rest your eyes from time to time to avoid eyestrain and headaches today. It's also important to remember to get out and go for a walk, weather permitting. Your body needs stimulation as much as your mind, and a walk will clear your head. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Today your mind will be quick, insightful, and inspired, Scorpio. Your creative impulses should go a thousand miles an hour and ideas should pop in and out of your head like crazy. Most likely you'll want to drop everything else and write down all your ideas. Make use of this inspiration while you can, as it may come in fits and starts. You could be surprised by what you produce.
 ----- 
 If visitors are able to pop in and out during the day, Sagittarius, you'll be in the right frame of mind to enjoy their company. Expect interesting news and stimulating conversation. At the end of the day, your mind may be going like a house afire, so it might be a good idea to take a walk or get some other form of exercise or else you might not be able to sleep.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if your inbox fills with email or your phone rings off the hook, Capricorn. Friends, relatives, and colleagues could have great news and useful information. One or more of these messages could inspire you to send a few of your own or even pay some visits. Most of what you learn should be positive and exciting, although some things may be confusing.
 ----- 
 Inspiration is the word for today, Aquarius. Your creative talent should blossom and motivate you to work on wonderful ideas. This could involve music, painting, decorating, or cooking. Relax and have fun with it. Whatever you do, you'll probably be pleased with the results. Feedback from others should be encouraging. Make notes of ideas you don't use today to remember them later.
 ----- 
 Today your physical and mental energy should be operating at a very high level, Pisces. You probably won't spend much time inside if you can avoid it. Expect get
 ----- 
 There's a fiery tone to the day that can't be ignored, Aries. You may find that adjustments need to be made in your own plan of attack in order to get on the same page with other people. Don't worry if things don't go according to your plans. In fact, the best route to take is the one that wasn't even planned. Do something that you've never done before.
 ----- 
 There's an extra spark in your eye that people won't be able to ignore. Today's a good day to get your point across, because you'll find people more open and receptive to new things than usual. Speak with confidence and you'll go far. It's important for you to say what you feel. If you don't, others will find reasons to walk all over you.
 ----- 
 Take yourself on a mental adventure today in which you explore new aspects of your world. Discuss philosophy and religion. Get to the core of a matter that seriously interests you. Now is a good time to consider taking classes or engaging in some form of higher learning. Your emotions come from a point of great power and you should use this energy wisely.
 ----- 
 Today is your day, Cancer, so live it up! If it seems like things have been rather intense lately, don't worry, they're apt to lighten up quite a bit today. Feel free to be your usual jolly self, the one who adds humor to the group. Your laughter will be appreciated. Come into the forefront. Bring things up to your level and you'll find that others willingly join you there.
 ----- 
 Be careful that you aren't acting in a way that you dislike in others, Leo. You could find that you're slowly taking on the traits of the people you despise. Lighten up a bit and put a smile on your face. If you continue to see the negative side of everything, it's likely that other people will only see the negative side of you.
 ----- 
 The day's general mood should fit quite well with your agenda, Virgo. There's no need to fixate on the negative. Keep things light and upbeat and worry about the consequences later. This is the time to be adventurous and explore. Don't let anyone else tell you how to run your show. You have a strong will and strong opinions, so don't be afraid to express either.
 ----- 
 You may need a translator to get through to people today, Libra. It could be hard to make decisions, but not impossible. Today's tip is to err on the side of adventure. Trust that good luck will pull you through if you take risks. You may feel unappreciated. Ask for help when you need it, but don't rely on others to heal you. Most of this work needs to come from within.
 ----- 
 Use your power resources today, Scorpio, as you have a great deal of dynamic energy at your disposal. You have the ability to transform and conquer anything now. Note that your spirit of adventure is apt to be more acute than normal, and you may be feeling quite anxious to get things rolling in a new direction. Don't hold back. Now is the time to do things full force.
 ----- 
 You could be asked to make some spontaneous decisions today that you might not feel entirely comfortable making, Sagittarius. You could feel you don't have enough facts to make an educated decision about what to do next. Realize that sometimes it's necessary to bite the bullet and make the best choice based on the knowledge you have. Be adventurous and trust your judgment.
 ----- 
 Emotionally, you may feel as if you're running up against a brick wall, Capricorn. It could be that your first reaction is to drown your sorrows in drink. Escapism is only a temporary remedy. If things slam in your face today, use this as an indication that you need to take necessary action. Don't keep bouncing around from one thing to the next in order to avoid the obvious. Face the music.
 ----- 
 Your emotions could be extra powerful today, Aquarius, although something may not feel as if it's sitting right. It could be a feeling of manipulation. Perhaps you've misjudged someone else's sensitivity and now they're working to get back at you in a subtle yet harmful way. Attend to your feelings and spend time alone if it helps you get more in tune with your emotions.
 ----- 
 Take hold of this day as if it's your own and use it to grow your dreams, Pisces. You'll find a great deal of power and dynamism in the air urging you to take the adventurous route. There's no need to hold back. The door is open and waiting for you to take the leap of faith to the other side. Don't even worry about consequences now. Your good luck will pull you safely through.
 ----- 
 Try not to lose sight of your own projects or desires, Aries. There's a great deal of power and manipulative energy in the air today that could throw you off course if you aren't careful. Have confidence in yourself and don't back down if things get too confrontational. Take control of the car you're driving instead of just coasting haphazardly down the hill.
 ----- 
 Recharge today by getting outside and stretching your arms to the sky, Taurus. Be proud and courageous. You have the power to turn an unhealthy situation into a positive one, but first you must get rid of all self
 ----- 
 Difficult predicaments could arise today if you try to exert your will over others without having the most honorable intentions, Gemini. It could be that you're using someone else's fear of you to control him or her. This doesn't make for a healthy relationship. Try not to snap at others. Make allies, not enemies, and you'll find that you will have nothing to fear.
 ----- 
 The fire within you is raging today, Cancer, and you should be careful how you wield this power. Be proud and triumphant. Walk with your shoulders back and head high. Freedom is important, but make sure that others don't interpret it as you not caring about a person or situation that's actually quite meaningful to you. Let your heart speak openly and honestly.
 ----- 
 There may be a great deal of fuss over something that seems quite insignificant to you, Leo. Try to see the beauty and importance of everything around you. At the same time, make sure you give yourself enough credit for being the person you are. Egos are apt to go through a bit of a transformation that will affect the way you react to the outside world.
 ----- 
 Things are coming to a critical point for you today, Virgo, and you may find that other people openly object to your actions. It's OK to be a bit selfish if the situation is appropriate. Look at yourself in the mirror and be proud of the person you see. Try not to get lost in the group or think that your personal success and happiness depend on the success of others.
 ----- 
 Feel free to speak more loudly today, Libra. You'll find that things fall into place more easily if you speak your thoughts outwardly and directly in the presence of others. Bring your internal power under your control instead of becoming a victim of the control games played by others. Your sincere heart is easily manipulated, so be careful that you aren't getting the short end of the stick.
 ----- 
 You should bask in a glorious splendor today, Scorpio. There's a great deal of power at your disposal. You'll find your ego is healthy, charged, and ready for the battlefield. Work lovingly with the energies that surround you. There's a great deal of fire in the air that will aid your pursuit of happiness. Don't settle for anything less than the best, because you're worth it.
 ----- 
 Add more sunshine to your day, Sagittarius. It may be time to stir up your inner passion and let it speak with greater confidence than you have been lately. Make sure you heal yourself by letting the people around you hear your truth loud and clear. Don't play games in order to please others. Stay true to yourself above all else.
 ----- 
 You'll find that your spark can easily turn potential energy into kinetic energy, Capricorn. Don't underestimate the power of your words. Realize the profound impact they have on others and take responsibility for their consequences. Try to use them sparingly if you can. Speak half as much as you normally would, but make each sentence resonate twice as powerfully.
 ----- 
 Don't dwell on your fluctuating moods today, Aquarius. Look at the larger trends and how positive elements are coming together in your favor. Stay optimistic and remember that you were put here for a reason. Respect and honor your values by staying in tune with yourself and the world around you. There's a profound power in your stillness, so cherish all moments of silence.
 ----- 
 This is your day to shine in all your glory, Pisces. There's no need to hold anything back. You'll find that you have a great deal of love to share. Your heart is likely to go to extremes today in order to prove its love, passion, and affection. Make sure that this energy that's so true to your core is appreciated and reciprocated by the people with whom you share it.
 ----- 
 You might feel more energetic than you have in a long time, Aries. A powerful energy that increases your mental acuity and physical strength can really help you finish anything that's pending. If you managed to accomplish so much already that you have time to spare, it's fine to help others with their load. Be sure to put yours first, though.
 ----- 
 If there's something you've wanted to take on, Taurus, today's the day. There's an increase in your physical and mental strength. Dispose of any insecurity or lack of confidence and take the steps to tackle a project or goal. You have an innate ability to make sound judgments and this is what you need to trust. Take steps to get what you want.
 ----- 
 If you've been feeling sluggish lately, this will be a welcome day for you, Gemini. You'll feel a surge in energy that greatly increases your creativity and physical strength. Seize the opportunity to be outside for sports or a walk. Such things will direct your energy and give your mind a chance to clear. Don't be surprised if you have more focus later. Make the most of this.
 ----- 
 Cancer, if there's something interesting that you've wanted to try, this is a great day for it. Adventure brings excitement, creative flow, and energy, which are essential to you. You're highly artistic. Continual stimulation is required to keep your psyche healthy. Experience something new today, even if it's a walk in a new place. You'll get the adrenaline you need.
 ----- 
 With today's energy, you can take steps toward getting things in order, Leo. Tackle desk drawers, closets, storage rooms, or filing cabinets. When you create order, you gain a sense of peace and personal control. Mental organization, such as goal planning, brainstorming, or scheduling, will add to this, too. Do what you can to clean out as many mental and physical corners as possible.
 ----- 
 Today's energy can have you feeling ready for anything, Virgo. Given your more radical approach, you may need to keep in check. Humanitarianism is part of your being, so if the pursuit of something you want hurts others, it would be a serious contradiction. Think through your actions before following through to ensure that you remain true to your ethical standards.
 ----- 
 Today might be a good day to take a second shot at something that didn't work out the first time, Libra. Falling flat on your face can damage your self
 ----- 
 Your ability to find innovative approaches to things may serve you well today, Scorpio. Strong energy and mental acuity continue today, and you'll find that most things come easily. When approaching projects, take extra time to consider possibilities. Try seeing things from every angle. You'll likely find far more choices than you originally thought there were. Jot down ideas.
 ----- 
 If long
 ----- 
 Don't worry about being productive today, Capricorn. You might still accomplish more than you have in a long time. The cosmic energy indicates that if you didn't get everything done that you wanted to yesterday, you're sure to do it today. Dig in your heels and go. Things will get done with time to spare. If you're into a creative hobby, work on that, too. You'll find it rewarding.
 ----- 
 Expect an added boost of physical energy today, Aquarius. It's an excellent day to clean out closets. Exercise like yoga or walking will be most enjoyable. It could also prove to be well worth your while to look at your goals. Are you where you want to be at this stage of your life or are there changes that need to be made? Give your brain and body a good workout.
 ----- 
 If certain projects or tasks have seemed difficult for you to finish, today's energy will give you the zip you need, Pisces. The energy indicates that things will go well for you once you get started. It's a good time to meet with others to discuss business or other arrangements. Your increased communication and cooperative skills will make decisions easier than usual.
 ----- 
 Are you satisfied with your current career, Aries? If not, start by making a plan. There are specific steps that you can take to give you the greatest advantage in the opportunities available. Consider visiting online career sites. There are wonderful articles and tips for the taking. Don't settle for less than you deserve. See what's out there and find a more fulfilling career.
 ----- 
 Don't fear change, Taurus. Even if you think you don't adjust well, you have far more adaptability than you realize. Without change, life would become stagnant and lifeless. It wouldn't be long before you grew unsatisfied and bored with the same old thing. Try to see change as an adventure and a gateway to greater happiness and fulfillment. Trust in your versatility, too.
 ----- 
 Make your dreams valuable tools for insight, Gemini. Back in the old days, great rulers believed so strongly in the insight of dreams that they employed interpreters. Whether you think dreams are mystical insights or random thoughts, you can gain a lot from them. Reoccurring dreams are significant and can point to something that needs addressing. Consider exploring this area.
 ----- 
 Follow your instincts, Cancer. Even if you tend to listen more to your reason, put that aside. While your ears can hear words, your intuition can hear what's between the lines and provide you with a much bigger picture. If something sounds right but feels wrong, you'll be better off trusting your feelings. Act with careful consideration and caution.
 ----- 
 Feed your mind with new knowledge, Leo. Visit an internet bookstore or read some interesting information online. If you have more time, visit the library, if possible, or explore courses that you might like. There is knowledge to be had everywhere you look, provided you're open to receiving it. People are often the best resource. Ask someone to explain something, if that's what you need.
 ----- 
 Try to see nightmares as safe ways to understand feelings, Virgo. No one likes to experience them, and we'd sooner forget them once awake, the quickest way to ensure they don't return is to understand what they're saying. Fear, pain, and anxiety are the most common ingredients of nightmares. What frightens you? Do you feel insecure? Consider the questions and probe for answers.
 ----- 
 Are you living your dreams, Libra? Are you still in touch with them? The energy from today's planetary aspects can lend strength and encouragement to this part of your life. Take hold of the things you want most of all. Ask yourself, "What do I want people to say about me when I'm gone?" Get back on the road to a fulfilled life by taking steps toward your desires.
 ----- 
 Today's a good day to check into advancing your career or education, Scorpio. The energy favors expansion and growth. When was the last time you learned a new skill? It doesn't have to be work related, either. If arranging flowers, skydiving, or programming websites is something that appeals to you, go for it. Never stop looking for ways to expand your knowledge.
 ----- 
 Do you recognize your intuition as a valuable asset, Sagittarius? Some people do and some don't. Which group are you in? It can be easy to trust more in concrete, factual reality than in the things you can't touch, yet your intuition can serve you more than you may realize. That gut feeling you experience can guide you toward greatness and alert you to danger. Trust it more.
 ----- 
 Use your creativity to make things happen today, Capricorn. This doesn't have to take the form of a finished product. You can come up with new and innovative ways to approach a task, project, or problem. Trust your ability to discover such things. You're known for your sharp thinking and creative abilities. Combining them can make you unstoppable when finding solutions to almost any problem.
 ----- 
 Find new ways to expand your horizons, Aquarius. The web has an infinite number of resources and information to explore. Not only that, but your community and local colleges offer various online courses to choose from. Think about what you'd enjoy learning 
 ----- 
 Step out of your usual role, Pisces. Doing this every now and then can add knowledge and expand your life. The day's planetary aspects favor such growth. Your willingness to walk a different path can give you far more than you imagine. Try something you've never considered before. Go to a new place. Change your desk around. See what you can discover about yourself and the world.
 ----- 
 This is an excellent day to express your natural creativity, Aries. The arts will more than likely be very important to you. You may find that nothing brings you more pleasure on days like this. Consider putting this to good use by painting, sculpting, or doing crafts. You'll find the perfect thing for you is engaging in art activities with a focus on giving.
 ----- 
 If you feel tired, Taurus, you may need to close your eyes and listen to soothing music. You work hard most of the time, so do your body and mind some good and just relax and listen to your favorite music. Even a few minutes will make a difference. You can always use the quiet time to plan if you feel you need to accomplish something.
 ----- 
 Today could bring some strong feelings, Gemini. This may not be new, as you generally tend to feel things deeply. Finding a way to express this could sometimes be tough for you. While you're creative, it isn't always easy to find the right activity to get you going. Visit an online bookstore and look for some appealing craft or art books. They may spark ideas for expressing yourself.
 ----- 
 Cancer, consider that artistic expression can happen in many ways. It isn't always about drawing a picture, singing a song, playing music, or acting. The way you arrange your home or workspace is an artistic expression, as are how you dress and do your hair. Each thing you do is an expression of your style. You are uniquely artistic. Enjoy this gift today.
 ----- 
 You may find that today brings great physical strength and energy, Leo. You may want to do some really challenging, physical work. This is the day for it, so why not go to it? Do some yard work or clean out closets, cupboards, drawers, and filing cabinets. Consider donating items that you don't use anymore or sell things online to make a couple bucks.
 ----- 
 Get into doing things today, Virgo. Activities that require focus or creativity are supported. Your physical strength and energy will compel you to do something active. If you've been feeling tired or under the weather, this can put an end to it. Consider artistic projects that take strength, such as building something out of wood or carving. Make something special for someone.
 ----- 
 Your active side may really show today, Libra. While you can be extremely focused on "thinking" work, you can also love keeping active and enjoy physical work. When you have a project like cleaning your home, you can be quick when you put your mind to it. This is a good day to get a lot accomplished. You'll probably enjoy it very much and bask in the satisfaction afterwards.
 ----- 
 If you've been feeling tired or sick lately, this will probably turn around for you today, Scorpio. Bouts of moodiness can be a real drain. Your emotional state has a pronounced effect on the way your body feels. Be sure to take care of your feelings as well as your body. If there are things that need to be worked out, do that now. The two really do go together.
 ----- 
 You'll probably be busy today, Sagittarius, and this may suit you just fine. This can really work in favor if you have some tasks to catch up on. Being energetic, active, and productive is natural for you. In fact, when you have to sit too long you probably feel restless or anxious. You may fidget, too. If you find yourself doing this, go find something active to do.
 ----- 
 Today, Capricorn, your ability to stand up for your decisions and not let others sway you may be enhanced. This will be especially strong if you've solved a problem. You may find that others often try to change your decisions, but not today. Things are working in your favor and you'll feel new strength as a result. Follow your heart.
 ----- 
 You may feel a need to get moving today, Aquarius. Almost everyone at times prefers quiet activities, books, art, and even just sitting around to physical activity. But your health can suffer if you're too inactive. Fresh air, exercise, and sunshine are vital to your well
 ----- 
 Pisces, you'll probably find that you have a ton of energy to put into all kinds of activities. Finish any work that still needs completion, consider doing some cleaning and organizing, or see about getting out for a little warm weather fun. Whatever you choose, make sure it's active. You'll need a place for all that energy to go and quiet activities won't cut it today.
 ----- 
 When was the last time you used a pen and paper, Aries? The keyboard has all but replaced these wonderful tools. In the same way that walking provides more than fresh air, the kinesthetic value of writing's rhythmic motion is far more soothing and healing than people realize. Moving your hand across the page can feel good. It unlocks places within that typing can't access. Try it.
 ----- 
 Today could bring a keen sense of empathy and understanding, Taurus. Verbal communication is likely to be enhanced. Take advantage of this by talking through any problems or issues with important people in your life. Go to visit or call to work things out. Most importantly, express your affection for those closest to you by telling them straight out what they mean to you.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if your mind goes a thousand miles a second today, Gemini. Slowing down will be difficult, and you'll have to find a way to express what's in your head. The planetary aspects lend strength to communication. Perhaps talking out your ideas or writing to someone whose insight you value will help. Even doodling can give you a place to put your thoughts.
 ----- 
 Welcome to another great day, Cancer! The energy from the planetary aspects is positive and encouraging, especially when it comes to communicating and interacting with others. Take advantage of this. Get together with friends and family for a pleasant visit, if possible. Consider inviting people over for games or dinner or do it virtually if need be. A potluck can be fun. You work hard all the time, so play gently today.
 ----- 
 You might be really interested in getting out and doing something with the special people in your life, Leo. You can thank the day's planetary aspects, which are conspiring to make this a perfect time to spend time together. Is there a place you're curious about and want to visit? Go today, if possible. Pack up the family and go for a fun day to check it out.
 ----- 
 Virgo, consider channeling your philosophical inspirations into creative writing, Virgo. It's probably something you'll enjoy. Even if you haven't expressed yourself in this way before, there's no better day than today to give it a whirl. Try your hand at poetry or fiction. If that seems too daunting, start a journal. This will give you a place to collect your thoughts and insights.
 ----- 
 You might need to be alone today, Libra. You're probably surrounded by people most of the time. It can be unhealthy if you can't occasionally be alone with your thoughts and feelings. It's critical to take care of your emotional well
 ----- 
 Today you may want to go your own way regardless of what anyone else wants, Scorpio. Your independence is important to you, but compromise might be needed in order to avoid conflict. Consider splitting your time between those close to you and yourself. Explain to your loved ones why you need alone time. If it's done with grace and humor, they'll undoubtedly support you.
 ----- 
 Today may find you in the mood for an adventure or a visit if possible, Sagittarius. When was the last time you took a day for something like this? It's probably been too long. Not only will you enjoy it, but others will be thrilled to spend time with you, too. Whether you invite a friend along or go alone, seize the opportunity to visit people or see someplace new.
 ----- 
 Serious thinking and communication are enhanced today, Capricorn. They're already strong qualities in you, and with this added boost, you'll need an outlet for expression. A journal is an excellent vehicle. Talking is another. If you have issues or worries, consider getting together with all involved and airing your thoughts. It's a perfect day to resolve problems.
 ----- 
 You might feel cornered into doing something you don't want to do today, Aquarius. Perhaps you made a promise to handle a project. Maybe someone decides it's the day to call in an I.O.U. Either way, say so if you aren't comfortable following through. Today's energy enhances your ability to express yourself and be understood. Rescheduling may be far better than potential resentment.
 ----- 
 You might find that someone close to you needs a hand today, Pisces. They could be too proud to ask for help. Don't let that stop you. If you see a situation in which you can help, do it. Don't wait for an invitation or request. Simply assess the situation and do what you can. Your efforts will be appreciated, and you'll feel good about making a difference.
 ----- 
 Take charge of your health today, Aries. You'll likely wake up feeling energetic. Take advantage of the energy boost from the planetary movements to actively do things that maintain your sense of well
 ----- 
 If you saw something in a craft shop or art studio that you'd like to buy but can't afford, consider making it, Taurus. Even if you don't think you're artistic, you could surprise yourself if you try. There are resources for novice crafters. They can give you the needed support and instructions. Don't dismiss your ability. Explore this avenue and see about finding a creative niche.
 ----- 
 It's the perfect day to head outside, Gemini. You'll likely be feeling positive and energetic, and the fresh air, sunshine, and physical activity may be long overdue. Even if you have to be inside for work, make the most of your breaks and lunch hour by walking. This evening could be the opportune time to get together with friends, if possible.
 ----- 
 It won't be surprising if you're frustrated with a close friend or partner who's far less ambitious than you, Cancer. The energy in the air can emphasize your dynamic ways of reaching goals and achieving success. Others who are passive or fearful may be difficult for you to understand. Yet people have to do things in ways that are best for them. Try to be patient.
 ----- 
 See about using your good relationships with friends and loved ones to get future group activities going, Leo. You're probably feeling great, and the idea of socializing appeals to you. See about inviting people over for supper or cards, when possible. If you're feeling especially lively, some sports may be just the ticket to get you moving. Do whatever it takes to have fun and get some fresh air safely.
 ----- 
 If you lack a regular exercise routine, Virgo, today's a great day to remedy that. Exercise doesn't have to exhaust you or hurt. Even activities like walking or yoga are excellent ways to stay healthy. Play a sport that appeals to you and you combine fun with exercise. Even dancing is a fantastic means of exercise. Find something that works for you.
 ----- 
 Put your ambition into action today, Libra. The day's planetary aspects should find you feeling energetic and positive, so take steps to achieve your goals. Nothing will happen if you don't actively pursue them. The years can pass quickly. You don't want to be sitting in a rocker wondering "what if." Trust yourself and do what it takes. Everything starts with that first step.
 ----- 
 Don't hesitate when it comes to taking on a project or making plans today, Scorpio. Extra energy will complement your organizational skills, making a perfect combination for handling almost anything. Write down your plans and goals to help stay focused. Get rid of things you never use. Consider donating these items, since there's probably someone who needs them.
 ----- 
 Today should go well for you, Sagittarius. Expect to feel a renewed energy and fresher perspective, especially concerning anything work related. Make the most of this by finishing projects that have been stalled or organizing your desk or closets. Feel confident that you can handle any task quickly. When everything is taken care of, make plans for a little recreation. You deserve it.
 ----- 
 Today you may feel very creative and ambitious, Capricorn. You might want to use this energy to work on an artistic project, or you may choose to channel it into such activities as organizing your home or workspace. If you plan for it, there should be plenty of time to do both if you have a mind to. Make the most of the day.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if you feel super today, Aquarius. Chances are good that you'll enjoy renewed physical strength, with energy to spare. It might be a good day to tackle any projects that require muscle. Perhaps there are household repairs that need tackling or furniture to move. You might want to go to the gym. Whatever the activity, this is a good day to go for it with gusto.
 ----- 
 The influence of the planetary aspects will bring an end to any lethargy you've been feeling, Pisces. It's an excellent day to head outside and do something active. Gardening or landscaping can make great use of your energy and creativity. Fresh air and physical exertion will benefit your health. Even if you have to work today, there's always the evening to enjoy.
 ----- 
 If your lifestyle is very different from others, resist feeling self
 ----- 
 Enhanced determination could motivate you today, Taurus, giving you the zip to plow through your work. Finish projects that have been pending and think about what you want to tackle next. Don't hesitate to do something that feels complicated or big. You'll probably be able to handle anything, and it will feel great when you're done. Making the most of any opportunity. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 Are you feeling the effects of today's low
 ----- 
 Make some plans for recreation, Cancer. Having something fun to look forward to can make even the toughest times far easier to handle. You'll be amazed at how much you can manage when there's an end in sight. Your whole attitude lightens, so take the bull by the horns and create your own incentives. Do something special to reward yourself for the hard work you do every day.
 ----- 
 Don't judge someone just because his or her lifestyle differs from what you consider normal, Leo. You may be traditional, but not everyone shares your view of relationships, work, or lifestyle. While this may seem hard to understand and even frightening to you, try not to be too hard on others. You'll be better off using that energy to keep your own life on track.
 ----- 
 Friends seeking advice or a shoulder to cry on may be plentiful today, Virgo. And you're one of best people to provide the support and caring they need. Just don't give so much to others that you have nothing left for yourself. True friendship is about sharing problems. Getting rundown will leave you in a place where you aren't much help to anyone.
 ----- 
 Getting through any work you have to do shouldn't be a problem for you today, Libra. Even if you flag for a bit, you're likely to get a second wind, and this will give you the drive and determination to see your projects to completion. Make plans for some fun after you're done, such as getting together with friends, if possible, or taking in an event that really intrigues you. You deserve it.
 ----- 
 Working within boundaries and restrictions could get to you today, Scorpio. Yours is an independent spirit, and your best achievements are often born of doing things your own way. Like it or not, we all have to follow rules. Finish what needs to be done. Afterward, you may find more freedom to act independently without consequences. Exercise patience and diligence as needed.
 ----- 
 Chances are that you'll feel upbeat and positive today. Share this energy with others who feel less than content. Your attitude can have a profound effect on friends, partners, spouse, and children. Neighbors and extended family can pick up on your spirit without you even realizing it. If someone is hurt or angry, be encouraging. Everything will eventually work out.
 ----- 
 Don't discount your excellent resourcefulness, Capricorn. If you haven't got everything you need or all of the information required, take some time to think. Who do you know? What resources can you access? Who might know where you can find what you need? Rather than panic because the pieces aren't all there yet, make a list of contacts and go for it. Trust in yourself.
 ----- 
 Try not to let the blues get you down, Aquarius. While it's true some days can seem to drag, the busier you stay, the faster time will pass. Get down to finishing any work still pending and make plans for an evening out. If there's a light at the end of the tunnel, not only will things seem to speed up, but you'll also feel better knowing you're almost done.
 ----- 
 Dare to be different, Pisces. It's easy to fall into routines 
 ----- 
 You may feel like you're being tested in some way and must prove that what you're doing is valid and correct, Aries. Fortunately, you should feel an emotional boost that will help you be confident about who you are, regardless of what other people think. The biggest tests are those that you give yourself. You are your toughest critic. Take concerted steps to go easier on yourself.
 ----- 
 You're able to assert yourself with more confidence than usual, Taurus. You should have a grounded perspective regarding your emotions. You aren't afraid to speak your mind in a situation where normally you'd only say anything that helps keep the peace. Other people may prefer that you keep things on an even keel, but you aren't working for them. You're working for yourself.
 ----- 
 Just when you feel like you've come to a point of emotional stability and calm, Gemini, something happens to throw you off balance. You may be uneasy with the notion of stability and feel what you really want is risk, action, and excitement. This inner conflict makes it hard for you to operate. Try not to overanalyze every piece of the equation. The solution will come to you.
 ----- 
 You have lots of energy and self
 ----- 
 Be happy with yourself and others, Leo. Stop trying to find fault with everyone you interact with. By criticizing what they do and how they do it, you could wake up one morning and find that you have no friends. By only seeing the bad in people, you may talk yourself out of relationships with them. Be careful about coming across as a know
 ----- 
 You may be bursting with energy and yearning to be a free spirit, Virgo. At the same time, your emotions could find a way to block these thoughts. You may feel like there's some sort of weight holding you down, making it difficult to act freely. This could cause you to act fitfully, leaving you frustrated and defeated. Calm down and take things one step at a time.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit blue due to a nagging weightiness that pins you down to reality instead of being free to fly, Libra. You may act out in an effort to prove to yourself and others that you're somehow above Earthly things. Get over the mental block that says being grounded is a bad thing. Plant your feet firmly on terra firma. That's how you find balance and attain your goals.
 ----- 
 You're able to work much more efficiently and effectively, Scorpio. Your energy is strong, and you don't need to fight in order to get your voice heard. Attend to details and don't get discouraged by any discomfort that might arise. As long as you approach things with a positive attitude, everything should work out fine. You shouldn't have to put in any special effort to be successful.
 ----- 
 Different people measure success by different scales. You shouldn't get discouraged if your accomplishment today seems small compared to what others have done in the same period. Comparisons will make it difficult for you to feel like you're getting anywhere. Someone else will always do more. Be content with what you do today, even if it's something simple.
 ----- 
 You could feel as if the battle has begun and you're the target, Capricorn. If you don't have a solid force behind you, this period could be difficult. Emotionally, this may not be your best day. Instead of feeling your feelings, you examine them in a methodical, rational manner. It may seem like you're dealing with them when you're really trying to talk yourself out of feeling them at all.
 ----- 
 It could be scary for you to do anything risky for fear of conflict or failure, Aquarius. Perhaps you've tried to become invisible in different situations so you can avoid being noticed. These defense mechanisms may serve you for a while but acting out of fear or guilt won't get you where you need to go. To achieve what you want, you must act with confidence, love, and faith.
 ----- 
 This is a terrific time to start some physical activity that takes you outside and gets your blood pumping, Pisces. Don't think this means you have to become the star player at a tennis club. A simple walk around the block every morning may be all you need to feel a boost in physical and mental energy. Also note the clarity of mind that comes when you get your body moving.
 ----- 
 A sum of money above and beyond your usual income could come your way. This could be a bonus, settlement, or even a gift of some kind. You could put it to work making changes in your home, perhaps repairs, perhaps remodeling or redecorating. This may seem like a daunting prospect, but you'll have the energy and enthusiasm in addition to the money. Go to it.
 ----- 
 Some vast changes in your community could take place, Taurus. They're positive, for the most part. Today the news should spread widely, and you could be hearing about it from all sides

 Today you could recapture the joy in life that you had as a child, Leo. You're serious by nature, and feelings of joy are to be lived and treasured. You could be experiencing true flow. There might not be any real reason for it, so don't try to find one. Your imagination and your relationships with others could be enhanced as a result. Relish the moment.
 ----- 
 Projects involving a group, perhaps your entire community, could take up a lot of your time, Virgo. Interesting news and stimulating conversations could come your way. Expect a lot of activity around you. You could be running around in the car, seeing people, getting errands taken care of. You could also find yourself changed somewhat 
 ----- 
 New ideas for your career could be on your mind, Libra. You might be thinking not only about getting a new job but also entering an entirely new field. This could be a positive development, but don't be too impulsive and leap without thinking. List your options, cross out the unworkable ones, and do some research on the rest. Even though you may feel some urgency, there is none.
 ----- 
 Continued success and good luck should have you feeling charged up to move ahead with plans and ideas. Your energy and enthusiasm are high, Scorpio. You're likely thinking about expanding your horizons, perhaps through travel or education. You should definitely give these serious thought. Plan carefully and take care not to move before the time is right.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if sometime during the day you feel angry for no apparent reason, Sagittarius. It's probably rooted in the past, from a situation that wasn't resolved long ago. Take a good look at what's going on today. Did some person or event awaken old traumas within you? Let them and the anger go. This can only benefit you and clear the way for more positive emotions.
 ----- 
 This is a great day to start new enterprises with others, Capricorn. Possible gatherings with friends or group activities could lead to ideas for new projects that fire your energy and enthusiasm. New immediate and long

 ----- 
 Does your job have a good profit
 -----

 Relations with family and other household members should be at their very best today, Leo. If you see colleagues outside of work, they could also be congenial and supportive.

 ----- 
 Words of love could be exchanged between you and your romantic interest today, Virgo. Obstacles to open and honest communication have been cleared away in the past few weeks.

 ----- 
 Expect some great news regarding money, possibly professional advancement. You may have to control the urge to break into tears of joy, Capricorn.

 -----

 ----- 
 Someone who interests you could seem to be showing interest in someone else. This might arouse your insecurities and cause a bit of jealousy. Don't make yourself crazy, Cancer.

 ----- 
 Someone is keeping secrets from you. We all have private issues, Leo, but this situation affects you. Your intuition will probably tell you who the person is.

 ----- 
 Either your lover or a colleague is likely to be irritable today, Taurus, which you might find upsetting.

This isn't a good day to host or attend social events or even accept invitations. Wait until a better time.
 ----- 
 Too many unfinished tasks may have you feeling pressured, Gemini, creating unnecessary stress. Pace yourself and don't panic if you have to let some go for now.

This should clear your head and make things easier for you.

Get some exercise or throw your passion into creative pursuits.
 ----- 
 Frustrated energy resulting from an inability to put plans into action could have your nerves on edge today, Scorpio. You might be tempted to get into petty quarrels with those around you.

 ----- 
 Overwork and the resulting stress and nerve strain could result in tension headaches today, Sagittarius. It might be a good idea to start the day pacing yourself and concentrating on the most pressing tasks. Don't worry if you have to leave some for later. There's a chance that others around you might get into some rather heated arguments. Stay out of it. This would only make you feel worse.
 ----- 
 You're probably feeling especially energetic but with little if any outlet for your energy, Capricorn. Increased irritability and frustration could tempt you to take it out on friends, children, or your significant other. On days like this you might want to consider jogging, yoga, or aerobics. These can produce endorphins that override the stress. Go for it.
 ----- 
 A conflict between career and home obligations could arise today, Aquarius. You may feel powerless, so it could make you feel irritable.

Whether dancing or jogging, just work off some of that frustration.
 ----- 
 This could be a challenging day, Pisces. You might receive a call that brings disconcerting news, making you angry or upset. You could be tempted to take it out on the caller, but don't.

Look into it and get all the facts before acting.
 ----- 
 If you're single, Taurus, love may come to you completely out of the blue today. The person could be standing behind you in line at the store or sitting nearby you in the park. Wherever you connect, don't be too cautious. Move ahead carefully, but at least get to know something about this person before giving in to insecurity and running the other way.
 ----- 
 Some unexpected but very welcome visitors could arrive today, Gemini. They might bring some people you don't know but should connect with right away. Expect interesting news, fascinating information, and a lot of laughs. Even though you don't know for sure that these people are able to come over, have a supply of drinks and snacks on hand. You'll want them to settle in and stay a while, if possible.
 ----- 
 Cancer, who's that intriguing new person in your neighborhood? What is it about this new neighbor that makes it impossible for you to stop wondering about them? Quit obsessing. Get your courage up and find a way to welcome him or her to the neighborhood. Maybe you'll find this person likable, maybe not, but give it a shot anyway. Enjoy.
 ----- 
 An unexpected letter could arrive today, Leo, with a check enclosed, perhaps a gift, bonus, or offer to make more money.

It might lead to more offers in the future.
 ----- 
 If you're in the arts or sciences, Virgo, sudden inspiration could cause you to start or continue a project that means a lot to you. Some friends or group members could help out with useful information. Your mind may generate new ideas throughout the day. Once you've finished your work, take a walk and clear your head. Watch a video. If you don't, it could be hard to sleep tonight.
 ----- 
 Meditation, dreams, or visions could bring amazing insights your way, Libra. You might find them too bizarre to believe, at least at first, but follow
 ----- 
 You're an adventurous soul, Scorpio. Are you thinking about a little mischief today? Are you going to propose that you and a friend or perhaps your partner skip town for a day and forget about work, chores, and other routine matters if possible? You've been bored lately, so who could blame you? If you decide to do this, make sure everyone knows what's up. You don't want to burn any bridges.
 ----- 
 An unexpected communication may come today from someone connected with your career, Sagittarius. This is good news, but it may be so off the wall that you could walk around in a daze for a while trying to make sense of it all. Don't agonize too much. You've worked hard for and deserve whatever it is that's suddenly coming to you. Think of it as a karmic reward. Go celebrate!
 ----- 
 An unexpected chance to fly to a faraway place, perhaps at someone else's expense, could come to you today, Capricorn. A group might be involved, perhaps one connected with education. Do you lecture or teach? If so, this might be a chance to give a lecture in an exciting place you've never been to before. Get your materials together, pack your bag, and go. Have fun!
 ----- 
 Some bizarre and rather silly dreams might come to you tonight, Aquarius. They may be the sort that is so crazy that you actually wake up laughing. Don't dismiss them. Silly or not, these dreams are trying to tell you something. Write them down the way you would any other vivid dream and analyze the symbols in the same way 
 ----- 
 If you're single, you could feel a very powerful attraction to someone unusual and perhaps a little wacky. If you're already in a relationship, you could glimpse a silly and rather insane side of your beloved you've never seen before. This could be a bit disconcerting but also make you laugh. That's part of the appeal of love 
 ----- 
 Your mind is buzzing like a bee, Aries. You're apt to find that there's very little you can do to slow it down. Make sure you add compassion to the chain that's holding everything together. Also make sure that you don't become a victim of your thoughts by losing control over how you act simply because the voice in your head has completely taken over.
 ----- 
 Mornings aren't usually your best time, Taurus. You aren't fully awake until afternoon. Try not to discount the events of this particular morning, however. More than likely, you'll enjoy your best mental clarity sometime before noon. Surprise people with an upbeat attitude and a solution for every problem that comes your way.
 ----- 
 Your world may seem rather tight and rigid this morning, Gemini, but the good news is that difficulties are apt to melt away as the day progresses. Don't assume that opinions are fixed in stone. Things can change in an instant. Even if they seem one way at one point, more than likely they're going to manifest themselves completely differently later.
 ----- 
 This is one of those days in which you're better able to stand back and look at your emotions intellectually, Cancer. Your freedom
 ----- 
 Prepare for a surprise today, Leo. Perhaps it will come from someone else or perhaps it will come from you. Either way, by evening you're apt to be feeling quite lovey
 ----- 
 Things seem to be going quite well for you in many respects, Virgo. Your thinking is clear, your emotions are under control, and the puzzle pieces are fitting into place. This is your time to take advantage of these pockets of good fortune and turn them into something huge. You have the power to make anything happen

 Your engine may sputter this morning as your gears begin to turn, Libra. It could be that you're working out something important in your mind that's helping clarify your emotions. The answer you seek is probably nothing like the one you'll find. By the time night comes, you'll have everything figured out. All the answers you need will be right there in front of you.
 ----- 
 Be careful not to overdo things today, Scorpio. You may so zealously want to meet your goals that you overshoot the mark by quite a bit. Feel free to express your exuberance and let your enthusiasm shine in whatever you do. At the same time, be careful about getting so carried away that you don't notice that you've already reached the finish line.
 ----- 
 Tempers may get hot today when someone says something that pierces you to your core. Address this problem right away, Sagittarius, instead of letting it fester through the rest of the day. The solution requires sensitivity and caring. Let the offender know that he or she has hurt you significantly, if that is indeed the case. There's no need for you to try to hide your feelings.
 ----- 
 Don't be surprised if you leap out of bed with a spark of inspiration that wasn't there last night, Capricorn. Let your dreams linger a bit before you face the world. This flash of genius is likely to strike quickly and unexpectedly, so keep an eye out for it, but don't consider it something that you can plan on or force into happening.
 ----- 
 Sometimes your emotions overtake your rational thoughts, Aquarius, and you end up acting on impulse. Today you'll find that your head and heart are aligned on significant issues, and that they're working well together. Try not to swing the other way by becoming too rational. Your goal is to find the best working balance.
 ----- 
 Review your day as you watch the sunset and observe the clouds turning from white to purple, Pisces. Make sure that your head is in tune with your heart. Think about the day's emotions and thought patterns and how they affected your actions. Determine if your actions were a result of either your rational mind or fluctuating moods.
 ----- 
 The emotional swings that you could feel today might put a damper on your fantasy world, Aries. Remember that it's up to you to nurture these dreams. Try not to let the emotional tides of the day affect your long
 ----- 
 People around you are apt to be touchy, Taurus, so be careful how you interact with them. You'll find that they can see beyond any sort of facade and easily detect dissention within the ranks. Be honest about your opinion, regardless of how you think it will be received. This is your best approach to a certain situation, especially since the truth will surface no matter what.
 ----- 
 While other people may be confused and distressed, you're actually the one with all the answers, Gemini. Indeed, you're best equipped to deal with the difficult situations that are likely to arise on a day like this. You have the ability to see through thick walls that others erect as barriers. Nothing will stop your penetrating eyes from seeing someone else's deceit.
 ----- 
 Be passionate about the thing you love the most, Cancer. Instead of trying to eat every single thing at the buffet table, just pick one or two items that you like the best and eat them with great enjoyment. Feel free to take some for later. Don't let anyone talk you into a dish that doesn't appeal to you. You're the only one who knows what you truly hunger for.
 ----- 
 You may feel like a skipping record, Leo. You've been scratched and mistreated, and now you continue to repeat the same thing over and over until you've driven your point home. This isn't your doing, so don't be concerned if you hear protests that you're sending others over the edge. This may be the very thing necessary for all of you to advance to the next step.
 ----- 
 There could be some tough forces questioning your most cherished dreams, Virgo. Be careful about confronting someone who wants to poke holes in your idealism. You could end up feeling like a punctured balloon that's slowly deflating. Do whatever you can to avoid the aggression at work to bring you down. Don't let others get to you.
 ----- 
 You're in a unique position to understand all sides of the issues, Libra. While this is apt to give you a tremendous advantage over those who still have their heads stuck in the sand, this knowledge also gives you a greater responsibility to others. You intuitively know what's best, and now you must find a way to bring others around and help them see it from your perspective.
 ----- 
 You may be feeling rather anxious, Scorpio. Perhaps you have a big date coming up and your mind is buzzing with how to make the best impression. Remember that the harder you try, the further away you'll push the object of your desire. The most important part of impressing another is having confidence. Relax. Try not to get too caught up with yourself.
 ----- 
 This could be one of those days in which you feel like you just can't get anything right, Sagittarius. In an effort to appease other people, you may think you have to make some adjustments that make you feel uneasy. This uncomfortable feeling could turn into nervousness, restlessness, and eventually anger. Don't feel like you need to be the one to make any sacrifices at this time.
 ----- 
 You may feel a need to add some fantasy to your daily routine today, Capricorn. Do you have someone in mind you'd like Cupid's arrow to strike? Well, don't rely on a cherub to do your work for you. Get out and do some target practice of your own so you'll be prepared when you see the object of your desire across a crowded room. Keep things light and cheerful.
 ----- 
 Your psychic sense is apt to be keen as you fill your mind with fanciful scenarios, Aquarius. These pictures in your head aren't as farfetched as you might think. Today would be a good day to listen to your inner guidance 
 ----- 
 You may be having a difficult time getting your opinions across to others, Pisces. For some, your ideas may seem too self
 ----- 
 Travel arrangements may have to be put off because of unexpected developments that keep you where you are, Aries. You may be worried about the consequences, but don't waste your energy. You'll be able to make the necessary trip and accomplish whatever you're hoping to do 
 ----- 
 You may feel especially lonely, overworked, and passionate today, Taurus, and therefore longing for the company of your romantic partner. But responsibilities involving you both could well be keeping you apart. This could be more than frustrating 
 ----- 
 Upsets in the home could occur today, Gemini. You and other members of your household are on edge and liable to snap at the least provocation. Someone could get all flustered over a minor problem and storm out. Don't worry. At day's end everyone should see events in their proper perspective, and all be friends again. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 Expected calls or deliveries may prove more trouble than they're worth, Cancer. You could get involved in endless games of phone tag, and deliveries might come when you're out. This can be avoided if you're prepared. Make sure everyone knows what you're expecting so they can watch for it. Tell people the best times to phone and be available at those times. Don't worry. You'll manage.
 ----- 
 A temporary delay in receiving some expected funds might force you to postpone a much
 ----- 
 Some older people, perhaps your parents, might be too vocal in their assessment of how you're handling a situation, Virgo. You're particularly sensitive today, and far less tolerant of criticism than usual. Don't lash out. Causing a rift won't solve anything. Change the subject and take whatever course of action you feel is best.
 ----- 
 Beware that creative efforts involving modern technology, such as computer graphics, recording, or film, might suffer from "too many cooks." Everyone has a different idea of how things should be handled. If this is your project, make sure everyone knows you're the boss. If you have partners, discuss the situation rationally with them. Don't sabotage your enterprise because of disagreements. Talk it over.
 ----- 
 In spite of the leaps and bounds you've taken over the last several months, Scorpio, a slump could set in as you start to doubt your ability to attain your goals. A disheartening and unexpected setback may have occurred, but you've never let this sort of thing stop you before. Don't fall into this trap now. Brace yourself, reassess your methods, and get back in the saddle.
 ----- 
 Are you waiting to hear some important news, Sagittarius? Significant career matters may be involved. This isn't a good day to sit around waiting. Your call will probably come late, when you least expect it. Turn on your voicemail, get dressed, and go out and do something else for a while. Otherwise you could well drive yourself crazy hoping for the news. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 This isn't a good day to travel, Capricorn, especially by air. Long lines at the ticket counter, endless delays, and lost luggage could be the result. This may not even be a good day to plan a trip, although you can consider your options. If you must fly today, get to the airport early, travel light, and take something good to read. That will make it bearable.
 ----- 
 A friend or colleague involved in an enterprise with you could be inhibited in some way by lack of money, Aquarius. This might involve some unexpected adjustment on your part, perhaps finding someone else to temporarily fill in. It's a pain, but you and your colleagues will manage, and your friend should have it together in time. Find a way to work around the situation. Hang in there.
 ----- 
 Career responsibilities may require a temporary separation from a love partner today, Pisces. This is apt to be upsetting and rather disheartening, but there's likely nothing you can do about it except work as quickly as you can so that you can finish and get back to your partner. Make sure your friend knows what's going on. You don't want to cause any more upset.
 ----- 
 Don't get pulled off track by empty promises today, Aries. Someone may try to sell you oceanfront property in the middle of Iowa. Beware of things that sound too good to be true. People may be talking quite a bit, but in reality, they probably have nothing to say. Don't waste your time trying to make sense of useless drivel. You've got more important things to do.
 ----- 
 Catch the wave of activity that's spinning in your direction today, Taurus. You'll find prosperity and good fortune within your reach. Expand your horizons and connect with others intellectually. Hurdles will shrink to nothing as long as you maintain a positive attitude. It will be tremendously easy for you to make great strides in any project you're working on.
 ----- 
 You may find it hard to trust others today, Gemini. Trust your instincts 
 ----- 
 There may be a bit of opposition coming at you, Cancer. There's a light, airy feeling that's prevalent everywhere. This is definitely the kind of energy you can connect with today. There's a great deal of strength in numbers. Don't let anyone try to stand in your way. It could very well be that they are operating on incorrect information.
 ----- 
 What seems like the perfect plan today may not necessarily seem like the perfect plan tomorrow, Leo. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. There's an expansive feeling in the air that's working to catch you up in its net and pull you into its plan. Beware of get
 ----- 
 There's a flurry of activity around you today that you should latch onto, Virgo. You'll be on a magic carpet ride that takes you into the clouds. The most difficult thing to remember is to not get so carried away that you lose sight of the ground. Keep in mind that things aren't always exactly the way they seem. What appears to work perfectly today may not work at all tomorrow.
 ----- 
 You'll find yourself working well with any group today, Libra. There will be a great connection between you and the people around you. Make sure you ground your relationships in something meaningful or else you could find that you've built a whole reality out of something that doesn't exist. Be true to yourself and try not to get fooled by anything that seems too good to be true.
 ----- 
 There's an incredibly expansive feeling in the air that you should latch onto, Scorpio. Things are moving rapidly. You'll find long
 ----- 
 Sticking close to home may leave you feeling like you're missing the boat on certain things, but you're probably better off, Sagittarius. People may make outlandish promises that sound good today but will basically flop tomorrow. Stay safe and don't invest a great deal of time or money in risky ventures. Keep moving at a steady pace. You'll find success your own way.
 ----- 
 You're riding a wave of prosperity and things are looking up for you, Capricorn. The situation today may appear too good to be true. The bad news is that's probably the case. It may be that the truth is being masked, and that there's a great deal of speculation and hype causing a frenzy of activity. Feel free to join the frivolity but realize that the bubble may burst tomorrow.
 ----- 
 The wind is blowing quite strongly today, and you'll find that things are flying around in a frenzy, Aquarius. This whirlwind of activity is threatening to pick you up, spin you around, and take you away. Be cautious of anything that suggests this. People may take on unrealistic attitudes that lure you into grand schemes. Beware of fanciful promises.
 ----- 
 Things are sporadic today, Pisces. You may find a thousand things on your plate, and all of them look delicious. There's a great deal of wind to fuel your fire, so let it burn red hot. You might get caught up in a frenzy of activity. Have a good time but realize that it might not last forever. The royal carriage is likely to turn back into a pumpkin at some point.
 ----- 
 Sit back and observe others' behavior today, Aries. Take a look at the people around you and figure out what makes them tick. You'll find that you can learn a great deal from their actions and mistakes. Consider your role models and people you wish to emulate. Think about the traits that attract you to certain people and work to adopt those traits yourself.
 ----- 
 Your love life might be a little fragile, and you'll find that your partner is more sensitive than usual, Taurus. A more caring, emotional approach to a situation will help you form a better connection with your partner. Today you'll find that clear boundaries need to be established in order to keep things running smoothly between you and your loved ones.
 ----- 
 Things in the love and beauty department should be going rather well for you now, Gemini, so it's a good time to make a move toward the object of your desire. Make sure that you're being completely realistic in your actions. Realize that you may need some discipline in this area. Maintain a healthy structure within which you can work.
 ----- 
 Slow down and take a more reserved, sensitive, and calculated approach to things today, Cancer, especially when it comes to matters involving love and beauty. You'll find a greater level of sensuality waiting for you when you're willing to open up the door even wider. Go after the object of your desire, but make sure that your approach is sensitive and disciplined.
 ----- 
 You may be at a rather climactic point now in the department of love and beauty, Leo. Your creative levels are peaking, and you might feel a strong urge to create something on a giant canvas. Realize that discipline is needed to get those artistic juices flowing. Don't let fear stop you. Initiate your dreams and let the details fall into place later.
 ----- 
 Pieces of your life that you've tried to avoid for some time may come to the surface today and cause you a bit of trouble, Virgo. That which isn't organized or structured is getting more and more chaotic just to teach you a lesson. Take care of things now. Put things in order and become more aware of the ticking of the clock. There's a reason you need to take care of business.
 ----- 
 Cupid has fired his arrow into your heart today, Libra, so snuggle up with the object of your desire. You'll feel more sensual and romantic than usual. Gourmet foods and fine wines should grace your plate tonight. Realize that there may be an element of restraint that needs to get worked into the equation, but don't let this stop you from having a good time.
 ----- 
 You may feel a bit of a creative block now, Scorpio, but don't view this as a signal to stop pursuing your artistic goals. The truth of the matter is that discipline is all that's needed to manifest the things you really want. Don't let other people's energies get in the way of where you are now and where you want to be. Get back in the flow.
 ----- 
 Today is an important day in which you can breathe creative energy into a structured situation, Sagittarius. You'll find that bolstering the aesthetics of your surroundings will help inspire you to be more disciplined and eager to keep things neat and tidy. Take your time and don't let other people's anxiety cause you to rush into anything you aren't ready for.
 ----- 
 Be a bit more selective in terms of where you put your energy today, Capricorn. Don't waste your time with situations that aren't healthy or conducive to your aims. You may find it hard to get motivated, but this is fine. This is a good day to lay low. Your energy is apt to feel rather sluggish, so be conservative with how you use it. Pace yourself throughout the day.
 ----- 
 Love and romance are coming your way today, but it's important to be practical, Aquarius. Don't take your relationships for granted. Realize that love doesn't necessarily mean that everything is perfect. Structure and discipline are often required in order to maintain a healthy partnership. You should be able to incorporate these elements rather well, so make the most of this energy.
 ----- 
 You probably should settle down a bit today in the love and romance department, Pisces. Realize that your relationships with others aren't a show or stage act to perform. This is a day when you should listen to feedback from your partner and think about restructuring certain elements of your relationship in order to make things flow more smoothly.
 ----- 
 Your brain and warrior instincts agree today, Aries. Team up with others who share similar thoughts and desires. Conversations can be extremely rewarding. You're apt to learn a lot about yourself. Don't be afraid to share deep thoughts and emotions. Your willingness to express yourself demonstrates how comfortable you are with your actions and feelings.
 ----- 
 Something or someone could confront you today, Taurus. Try not to assume things about the situation before you know all the facts. If a piece of the puzzle is still in question, face the issue right away. Your sensitivity is precious, whether you realize it or not. Small things can slowly eat away at your psyche until they're addressed and dealt with.
 ----- 
 Have no fear today, Gemini. You have the power and mental capacity to cut through just about anything. Don't let fear or regret hold you back. Clear the path and be strong in your approach to the new and different. Stay on target and be bold in your actions. You have the ability to conquer new literal and figurative lands. Release mental blocks that might hinder your success.
 ----- 
 Don't worry about not being on the right path, Cancer, because you are. You seem to always be in the right place at the right time. There's no need to feel regret or shame about things that have happened in the past. Turn negative experiences into lessons for a better future. Even though you may not be able to change a certain situation, you can at least change your reaction to it.
 ----- 
 A war could be brewing in your world today, Leo. Emotionally charged arguments shoot back and forth with conviction. Try not to get discouraged. Don't burn any bridges either. Remember that your words may fall on extremely sensitive ears, so use them with care. There's a very active part of your psyche that needs to be heard. Feel free to say your peace openly and honestly.
 ----- 
 An inner voice is warning you to slow down, Virgo. It's probably best if you take a break and let someone else take the lead. Concentrate on matters at home and take care of issues that crop up among loved ones. It's quite possible that an argument is brewing. Whether you realize it or not, there are serious issues that need to be addressed.
 ----- 
 Today is a fantastic day to take action, Libra. Your eagerness to strike out for new territory is heightened by a drive to experience the unknown. Take an internal journey and see what kind of wonderful things you can discover. There's a tremendous strength inside you that doesn't always get to show itself. This is the perfect day to prove your courage to the world.
 ----- 
 Think before you act today, Scorpio. Rash moves are likely to get you into trouble. An annoying interruption in your daily routine could throw you off guard. Sit down and think about the situation before you act too hastily. Bumps in the road are often messages from the universe that you're moving too quickly and carelessly. It's time to slow down.
 ----- 
 Today is a great day to act on things that have been brewing in your brain for quite some time, Sagittarius. Perhaps you've been feeling unsure of yourself. It's OK to surrender and admit that you just don't have all the answers. Use this as an opportunity to restructure and rebuild. Embrace the unknown rather than fear or resist it. This is a great time to move toward it.
 ----- 
 Be a bit more sensitive with your words today, Capricorn. Your mind is apt to be especially active and even a bit restless. This is more than likely a signal to get more of your opinions out into the world. As you do, make sure you consider the feelings of others. People might have quite a different reaction to the same situation. Respect opposing viewpoints.
 ----- 
 Your mind is clear and your sensitivity focused, Aquarius. Now is a good time to make a move. Don't let insecurity or fear keep you from pursuing your dreams. Realize that action you take today doesn't need to be a bold outward movement in order to be effective. In truth, quite the contrary is true. You can accomplish a great deal by turning thought and energy inward.
 ----- 
 Cool your jets today, Pisces. This is a good time to stop and focus on you. Make sure to give your body the respect it deserves. Make sure you're fostering the kind of character you wish to become. Base your self
 ----- 
 You seem to be filled with questions, Aries. Some of them are big, some trivial. All you know is that they preoccupy you, and the answers aren't readily apparent. Don't fret. All that will change by day's end. The planetary configurations are such that all the confusing events of recent days will begin to make sense. Your world will once again seem calm and orderly. Enjoy it.
 ----- 
 You're an individual, Taurus, but sometimes it's hard for you to suppress your uniqueness in order to get the job done. It may not be you. The problem may be your job. If you're feeling like you don't have enough fun in your life or you aren't using the full potential of your creativity, this might be a good time to make a change 
 ----- 
 Your ego may be bruised by events from a few days back. Has it occurred to you that it's within your power to right the wrong you feel was done to you? It isn't a matter of confrontation but of conversation. The person in question is probably unaware of what they did or said. An expression of your dismay might elicit an apology. You'll both feel better for having cleared the air.
 ----- 
 Today's planetary configurations are pushing you to get some perspective on your life and the lives of people closest to you, Cancer. You must admit that you've been rather selfish lately. You aren't the center of the universe, so why do you sometimes act like you are? This is a day to make amends with friends and loved ones. They'll welcome you back with open arms.
 ----- 
 This is a day to be up front with your partner, Leo. It's possible that your relationship has reached some sort of stalemate. It's up to you to get that fire burning brightly once again. How? You know the drill 
 ----- 
 This is a day of untold opportunity, Virgo. If you've been concerned that you haven't been using your full creative potential, you can put that concern to rest today. Your creativity is boundless and you'll finally realize it. Be on the lookout for any unusual opportunities. Someone or something you encounter could have meaningful ripple effects on you.
 ----- 
 There's tension in the air today, Libra. Even though it isn't your doing, you may want to keep a low profile, especially if you need to work. Try to avoid any discussions. Just because someone is confrontational doesn't mean you have to rise to the bait. It would be better if you didn't. Keep to yourself and all of this will blow over by tomorrow when it will be safe to mingle again.
 ----- 
 You're a dreamer at heart, Scorpio. You prefer not to think about material things. That explains why you tend to forget groceries or dry cleaning. You're happiest if things get done for you. But circumstances today will force you to handle some of these mundane chores. You'll feel better by day's end just knowing you can be self
 ----- 
 If you follow your instincts and dare to take some risks, Sagittarius, you'll be handsomely rewarded. You have the capability to make a good project great. Do your best not to get distracted today. Keep your eye on the big picture rather than let yourself get bogged down in details. You'll find that when you take care of the big issues, the little ones take care of themselves.
 ----- 
 Finally, Capricorn, you'll be able to breathe a long overdue sigh of relief. It's likely that you've been worried about your finances for some time. Well, you need worry no longer. The events of today either put you back in the black or show you a clear path to get there. You've been working hard to resolve these financial matters. You can now start working smarter.
 ----- 
 Separate the wheat from the chaff today. Look at your relationships and decide who your true friends are. You're loyal, which is to your credit, but why be loyal to people who don't return it? You've given these so
 ----- 
 Whether you acknowledge it or not, Pisces, creation is the central theme of your life. If you aren't an artist or writer, you should be. There are plenty of creative ideas in your head clamoring to be expressed. Why not give it a try? You have nothing to lose, and you may be astonished by what you're able to produce. Your brain does have two sides. It's time to use both.
 ----- 
 This is going to be a rather intense day, Aries. On the positive side, you'll accomplish a lot. On the less positive side, you may be exhausted by the end of the day. You're advised to try and pace yourself. Remain focused on what's truly important rather than let yourself get caught up in trivia. Keep the big picture in mind and the little things will take care of themselves.
 ----- 
 Today it's important that you make your own decisions and stick with them, Taurus. Much as you prefer to depend on others, your judgment really is best. You'll be paralyzed if you think only of how others will react to your decisions. You do know what is best, and everyone will benefit when you act on your beliefs. This is no time to be wishy
 ----- 
 You're a dreamer, Gemini. Everyone loves you for it, but today the planetary aspects urge practicality. There are personal issues to resolve, and it does no good to have your head in the clouds. This is a time to focus on loved ones. Perhaps your partner or your children feel neglected. Do whatever is necessary to let your family know you're available and eager to give them what they need.
 ----- 
 Much has happened recently, Cancer. Have you allowed enough time to process it? It's likely that big changes are brewing at home or work. Stay focused on the job at hand rather than fret about events over which you have no control. You may feel as if you're on a roller
 ----- 
 You've made progress these past few weeks, especially where your temper is concerned, Leo. It has taken some effort, but it does seem that you can overcome your tendency to speak before thinking. Don't lose the ground you've gained. There's one person whose mission seems to be to make you explode. Don't let him or her rankle you. Take a deep breath and rise above it.
 ----- 
 This is likely to be an intense day, Virgo. Family and friends may seem testy, so you're advised to stay out of their way. Don't worry 
 ----- 
 This isn't the most cheerful time, Libra, because important issues are rearing their heads again and forcing you to address them. You'd rather not, but you can't wish them away. The time has come to deal with them once and for all. It's especially important that you make an effort to make your home life more positive and upbeat. Your loved ones look to you to set the tone.
 ----- 
 Don't try to force anything or anyone right now, Scorpio. You'll find that today's elements are just as stubborn as you are. Today's planetary configurations will force you to finally start to turn your dreams into reality, whether you want to or not. Face it 
 ----- 
 You're incredibly productive, with good business sense, Sagittarius. However, lately you may have felt dissatisfied with where you are in life. As you look around, you might wish you had more possessions to show for all your hard work. Don't pursue this line of thought. Real value comes from relationships and the pride you get from doing a job well. A new car or fancy clothes may lift your spirits, but it's superficial.
 ----- 
 You have a keen analytical mind that has served you well in business. Alas, Capricorn, this characteristic doesn't always serve you well in your personal life. It's likely that someone close has bristled from your lack of empathy. Take time to reflect upon the events of the past few weeks. Did you inadvertently send a wrong message? Correct any unintentional slights. A simple "I'm sorry," will do wonders.
 ----- 
 This is the beginning of an exciting period in your love life, Aquarius. Your relationship with a significant other may have been in a rut lately, but that's about to change. Both of you are ready for something big. Perhaps a move is in store or you could both decide commit to one another more permanently. Follow your instincts, because they'll lead you where you're meant to go.
 ----- 
 You have a passionate nature, Pisces. Sometimes it's difficult for you when other people don't share your exuberance. This is a good time to tone things down a notch. There's some tension in the air, and your enthusiasm only serves to annoy rather than charm, as it usually does. Don't pout. It's only temporary. Tomorrow you'll be the center of attention again and bestowing hugs and kisses to all.
 ----- 
 Regardless of how you feel today, Aries, it's important to own up to your mistakes. Keep in mind that you're responsible for your actions. No matter how much you might want to shrink away, it's important to stand up and admit your weaknesses. Take bold action today in which you command control of the situation and hold yourself responsible for the consequences.
 ----- 
 There's an important lesson to learn today, Taurus, so don't shy away from the classroom. It's important to control your attitude now or it's likely to control you. It could be that your ego is a bit too inflated. You may end up turning people away if you aren't aware of how your actions affect them. Or it could be that you need to change your approach.
 ----- 
 Consider the romantic relationships in your life right now, Gemini. It's important to remember that regardless of how hot and steamy a partnership is at first, it's vitally important that there be something to replace that attraction once the initial romance wears off. Build your relationships from the ground up. Make sure that your romantic partner is also one of your very best friends.
 ----- 
 Today is your day to become a hero, Cancer. You don't have to be dressed in fancy tights and a cape to make an important difference in someone's life. Step up to the plate even if it isn't your turn at bat. True heroes are the ones who are able to do what needs to be done when necessary, regardless of the circumstances.
 ----- 
 There's a great deal of fun to be had today, Leo. Money isn't always necessary to make this happen, however. In fact, money isn't a great way to keep score. Consider the sacrifices you make each time you strive to earn more cash. There's a dynamic feeling in the air today that's asking you to expand your mind in order to consider other ways to have fun.
 ----- 
 Remember that the important thing isn't necessarily what you're doing but the people you're with, Virgo. There's a great deal of passion in the air today that you can latch onto and put to good use. Have fun and remember to smile. You can make a great deal of progress toward your goals as long as you stay motivated. Connect with others and feel the strength of shared resources.
 ----- 
 You could learn a tough lesson today, Libra. More than likely, the harder the message hits you, the more important it was for you to hear. It's important that you accept failure gracefully. It could be that the one who kicks you when you're down will also be the one who helps you get up. There are strange twists to this day that you may not expect. Take things in stride.
 ----- 
 There's a great deal of fuel to keep your fire raging today, Scorpio. Powerful situations are apt to come your way in which you're asked to take decisive action. Don't shy away from added responsibility. Your ego is very strong, which helps you take charge of any situation. Just make sure that you don't step on anyone's toes in the process.
 ----- 
 Remember that one wrong move today could cause you to have a headache for a good long while, Sagittarius. Don't take uncalculated risks. There's dynamism and confidence in the air, and even though you may be tempted to step off the ledge, think twice about doing so. Keep your parachute handy. Maintain your internal power by celebrating your uniqueness instead of your need to show off your daredevil spirit.
 ----- 
 It's a long road to becoming exactly the person you want to be, Capricorn. You can't change who you are. Input from every person you know and lessons from every bump in the road contribute to who you are as a person. Be proud of yourself, but also realize that there's a great deal more internal development that needs to be done. Meditate or be alone for a little while.
 ----- 
 You should always leave a loved one with loving words, Aquarius. Each time you exit a room, consider that you're never going to enter that room again. Perhaps you'll never see those people again. Make sure you take care of the people you like. People might need extra attention today to feel appreciated and important to you. Cuddle up to the people who mean the most to you.
 ----- 
 Just when you think you have absolutely no energy left, you're able to kick into a higher gear. Push beyond your limits today, Pisces. You'll find that you can achieve a great deal more than you thought. All you need to do is have confidence in yourself and try. You have a lot of dynamic power on your side. You will find that your strength is greater than ever.
 ----- 
 You'll find that your brain is extra sharp today and you have a greater sense of clarity regarding your purpose in life. It could be that your nurturing instinct is high and your general self
 ----- 
 Many people conduct their lives without really making conscious decisions about their actions. People walk around like they're asleep. Don't fall into this trap, Taurus. This is a good day to dust off your thinking cap and take action. Don't let others make decisions for you. Take control of your destiny. To maintain the balance today, it's important that you swing toward the sensitive side of things.
 ----- 
 Your thinking is clear today and you'll find that it's right in sync with who you are, Gemini. Find your strength in conversations in which you display your keen insight into the situation at hand. Your detective
 ----- 
 It's OK to be wrong, Cancer. If you know you've made a mistake, feel free to admit it. Don't let your ego stand in the way of progress. Others won't want to deal with you if you insist that what you're doing is right all the time when perhaps it isn't. Your mind may be a bit more fragile on a day like this, so try to be more sensitive and receptive than usual.
 ----- 
 Be careful about being too critical today, Leo. You're likely to turn people away if you aren't careful with how you express yourself. This is a good time to listen and receive as opposed to deliver information. Let things stew in your head for a while before you make any major decisions. You're likelier to find a greater balance in the situation if you slow down and back off a bit.
 ----- 
 Your mental ability could be rather sluggish and lazy today. It could be that you aren't feeling as sharp as you'd like, Virgo. This is most likely a sign that you simply need to slow down and relax. Don't feel as if you always need to deliver the keynote address. Be more of an audience member today and take advice from the other people up on stage.
 ----- 
 One of the important lessons of the day for you is to remember that emotions are powerful things to recognize and honor. Don't discount your feelings. In fact, it's most important that you embrace them with your whole being. Once you relax and settle into your true emotions, you'll find that your mind clears and you can make conscious, rational decisions about whatever issues come your way.
 ----- 
 Someone may be calling you on certain behaviors today, Scorpio. It could be that your aggressive nature rubs someone the wrong way and they simply don't have thick enough skin to take it. You may not even be aware of how your warlike attitude affects those around you. This is a good day to see things from someone else's perspective in order to gain a bit more data on the situation.
 ----- 
 Your mind is thinking quite clearly today, Sagittarius. You'll discover that you have a keen ability to tune into the subtle energies that are moving through your life right now. The good news is that your ego and brain are working together, and you may be able to strike a better balance between these two elements of your psyche much more easily than usual.
 ----- 
 Your receptivity to new ideas is stronger than usual today, Capricorn. Listen to what people say and remember that you can learn from every person you meet. There's a lesson in every situation. Remember to keep your brain exercised, just like any other part of your body. To keep it working properly, you must make sure you give it the daily stimulus that it requires.
 ----- 
 Your mental clarity is astounding today, Aquarius. You'll find that your pattern of thinking reflects exactly who you are at the core of your being. The moment you walk out the door this morning, you'll find that your brain wants to process everything. This action will give you greater assuredness and insight, making this a terrific day to stand up and speak your mind.
 ----- 
 Tune into the thoughts of others, Pisces. Focusing only on yourself means you're missing the beauty and wisdom that come from other people. Respect their opinions the way you want them to respect yours. Your ego might get in the way of your brain until you embrace the lesson of sensitivity that it's trying to teach you. Take a back seat and let someone else do the talking.
 ----- 
 Today you should work to tune into the larger, slower
 ----- 
 Let your artistic nature loose today, Taurus. Add a touch of creativity to whatever project, situation, or person you encounter. Let your fantasy world extend to every aspect of your being and keep an open mind for new ideas and methods. Incorporate traditional values into new concepts. The new and the old methods may seem incompatible at first, but it's your challenge to make them work together.
 ----- 
 Don't gamble away your resources, Gemini. Take the safest route. There's a great deal of energy out there encouraging you to act, but beware of adopting too stubborn of an attitude. This will only succeed in alienating you from the very people you rely on for support. Maintain a strong, healthy balance between old and new. Try to be more open to change and, by all means, adopt a more flexible attitude.
 ----- 
 Get things out in the open today, Cancer. If someone seems to insult you, call them on it. Letting things fester inside only destroys your self
 ----- 
 Stick to the tried and true today, Leo. Don't be afraid to make any last
 ----- 
 Reap all the riches that a new day has to offer, Virgo. Every day brings new opportunities and the chance for rapid advancement. Grab the things offered to you. You have a great deal of potential, but potential is one of those things that does no good until you realize it and harness it. Today is one day in which you can take an important step toward manifesting your dreams.
 ----- 
 You may need to adjust today in order to relate well to people and situations, Libra. Things are a bit off kilter, and you may find that the harder you try to fit in, the more liable you are to feel like an oddball. Try not to get caught up in others' battles. Maintain a balance between real life and fantasy. Don't get so caught up in someone else's world that you forget to deal with your own.
 ----- 
 Be yourself today 
 ----- 
 Today is a very expansive day in which you can make great progress in all of your endeavors, Sagittarius. Be careful of deception by others. There may be a surreal cloud that covers up reality. You may need to do a little digging to locate the truth. Maintain a mellow attitude in order to stay safe. Sudden, extreme actions fueled by anger or fear are likely to get you into trouble.
 ----- 
 Tune into your dreams today, Capricorn. Do you often feel intensely jealous thinking the people around you are living amazing lives while you're stuck in a dull, boring routine? The only person who can pull you out of this rut is you, so stop complaining and do it. Change is easier than it seems at first. Let your imagination take control and work toward manifesting your most fanciful goals.
 ----- 
 There are extremely slow
 ----- 
 There may be a great deal of conflict in your life today, Pisces. Different people and situations seem to be pulling you in all directions. Your sanity is being put to the test. Try not to be too stubborn, because this will only cause more tension between you and the situation. You have the potential to stress out about the smallest things. Try to avoid this if you can.
 ----- 
 You might have to do a bit of adjusting today in order to experience a harmonious understanding with the people around you, Aries. Adopt a feistier and more aggressive attitude toward love and romance if you want to receive any attention in that area. Feel free to go for the gold. Sitting back and lying low will most likely get you nowhere. Take the initiative. Be brave and go out on a limb.
 ----- 
 Your love life is a kaleidoscope of shapes and colors today, Taurus, full of complicated patterns and ever
 ----- 
 Turn up your aggressive nature regarding your romantic life, Gemini. You may find that a small spark is all that's needed to rekindle a smoldering fire. You may be going through a period of transformation right now when it comes to this area of your life. If so, consider all the options and don't shy away from a new way of relating. Your partner may have the very answer you seek.
 ----- 
 Today is a very powerful day for you, Cancer. You may find yourself going to extremes in certain areas of your life, especially when it comes to your romantic nature. You could be pulled way over to one side and then to the other. At first you may give it your all and the next minute completely withdraw. Try to find a balance in this seesaw game.
 ----- 
 You may not understand what all the fuss is about today, Leo. Suddenly there's a fire burning all around and you may be left questioning the motivations behind others' actions. You may not be able to make heads or tails of the situation, so don't waste your time trying to figure it all out. Let it be. Take a hint from others that you may need to add a bit of spark to your life to spice things up a bit.
 ----- 
 Get your broom out of the closet today, Virgo. Your job is to brush away the cobwebs from the corners of your emotional bedroom. Use the intense transformative energy of the day to say goodbye to stale and unsatisfactory relationships that have left a bad taste in your mouth. Ignite the fire of a new situation and consciously try to establish new habits so that old patterns don't continue to repeat themselves.
 ----- 
 There may be a great deal of charge in your battery today, Libra, but you could be unsure about where to put all this energy. Get up and do some exercise. Give your body the workout it needs. Remember what it's like to sweat. You'll feel much better about yourself afterward, and you'll be much more likely to continue on a healthy path if you push your body to its limits.
 ----- 
 Let your love light shine today, Scorpio. There's a great deal of passion in your heart that needs to be expressed. Let your romantic nature take the reins, and allow your creative nature to blossom. Be assertive with regard to the ones you love. Muster your courage and feel free to take the lead. Be loving and caring without being smothering and clingy. Give others room to breathe!
 ----- 
 People might be a bit argumentative when it comes to romantic issues today, Sagittarius. Your instincts could be telling you to restrain yourself and hold back, while the prevailing winds are urging you to strike out for new ground. Realize that your heart may need a bit of freedom and detachment. Your sensitive nature could be causing you to read too much into the issues at hand.
 ----- 
 Consider going on a trip with a close loved one, Capricorn. A long
 ----- 
 Today is one of those days in which if you want love, you need to go out and get it, Aquarius. Don't waste your time sitting at home and sulking. Be adventuresome and take that first step. You're the only one who has the ability to pull yourself out of the rut, so do it. There is a great deal of passion behind your romantic intentions at this time, Cupid, so be careful where you point your arrow.
 ----- 
 Things should flow extremely well for you today, Pisces, especially when it comes to anything having to do with love and beauty. Throw a party, or at least invite some close friends over for dinner. A tremendous fire from within fuels your romantic and social nature. Your creativity is at a monthly peak, and you'll find that, in general, your relationships with others will go extremely well.
 ----- 
 Don't be so nosy about others' affairs today, Aries. If you were meant to be included in the conversation, you'd have been invited. Suspicion of other people's actions and motives will only cause them to lose their trust in you. Keep any abrasive and critical thoughts to yourself. Perfection is a hot topic in your mind. Realize that the only person you can control in that department is you.
 ----- 
 Other people could have some seriously opposing opinions about how things should be done. Be prepared for battle, Taurus, because others are likely to have sharp tongues. Compromise is the key to finding solutions that will work for everyone. Realize that the best solution is probably one that neither party has thought of on his or her own. Work together to come up with the best situation for everyone involved.
 ----- 
 Information is apt to come in erratic bursts today, Gemini. You'll find that a great deal of nonverbal communication is revealed and you should listen not only with your ears but also with your eyes and heart. Keep an open mind. Let others finish their thoughts before you make any judgments. You're probably better off not making any judgments at all. Let people say their peace.
 ----- 
 An unexpected opportunity to take a short trip could present itself today, Cancer. Hop on that boat or train and see where it goes. If you have no real reason to travel, make one up. You don't need one anyway. The point is that it's time to get away from your current surroundings and explore other ways of living. If the time isn't right for you to get out and travel, at least make a plan now for a trip later.
 ----- 
 If you aren't paying close attention today, Leo, you might miss what's said. Important information is being relayed quickly, so don't miss out on the action. It may not be important for you to agree with everything you hear, but at least listen to it and seriously consider incorporating elements into your point of view. Don't dismiss other opinions just because they're new and different from your own.
 ----- 
 Actively express your thoughts today, Virgo. You'll find that a great deal of information needs to be exchanged. You have the power to deliver a strong, thoughtful message to others, so don't give up this opportunity to exercise your acute mind. You may also find people to be rather argumentative, but don't let this keep you from expressing your true thoughts on the matter at hand.
 ----- 
 You may be feeling a little bit lost in the dust today, Libra. Somehow what you're thinking and feeling isn't exactly coordinating with the current conversation. Don't think you need to agree with the group just to feel like you fit in. Maintaining your own point of view is critical. You're better off rolling with the punches rather than trying to put up a fight.
 ----- 
 Your thinking is clear and sharp, Scorpio, and your mental awareness keen. You should use it to head toward new, forward
 ----- 
 You're apt to come up with some new, radical thoughts today, Sagittarius, which you should feel free to share with others. There are opportunities around that you should grab hold of. Be aggressive about pushing ahead with your progressive thoughts. Communication with people who possess opposing viewpoints will prove quite valuable. Take a lesson from the bizarre and outlandish.
 ----- 
 Today is a terrific day to express your thoughts, Capricorn. You'll find your mind especially clear and ready to tackle any mental issue that comes your way. Your tendency is toward free and unconventional ways of problem solving. Express the importance of being able to think for yourself. Write letters, make calls, and surprise someone with a personal visit. Connect with friends you haven't spoken with in a long time.
 ----- 
 Someone may challenge your mental capabilities today, Aquarius. Your natural tendency might be to take the information, mull it over for a while, and come back with your decision or opinion at some later date. The truth of the matter is that things are moving quickly and decisions must be made quickly and efficiently. Stay on your toes and have confidence in your mental processes.
 ----- 
 Unexpected information may be coming at you today from out of the blue, Pisces. You'll find that this information is extremely important, so make sure to keep all lines of communication open. You're apt to learn some important lessons regarding working harmoniously with groups to fulfill not just your own needs but also those of others. Let other people's viewpoints be heard.
 ----- 
 Your brain is likely to be working overtime, Aries. Things were going along just fine until you suddenly ran into an unexpected snag that kept you from where you want to be. It's as if the hamster wheel you've been running on suddenly jammed. Even though you're still working just as hard, the wheel simply won't turn. Perhaps it's time to step off and take a break. Get some perspective.
 ----- 
 Try not to get too wrapped up in the mental side of things, Taurus. Perhaps you're trying to work everything through in your mind. You'll find that there are strong forces outside your own trying their hardest to manipulate your thinking. It might be good to step away from the situation and do more processing with your heart. Go with your instincts rather than rely so much on your thoughts.
 ----- 
 It's possible that you've been so emotional about a certain issue that you've taken it way too far, Gemini. Fortunately, your reasoning has finally caught up with your feelings. Now it's time for a reckoning. Give your brain a chance to sort things out and bring the situation back into equilibrium. Your first tendency may be to overreact and have things swing in the opposite direction. Do your best to resist this temptation.
 ----- 
 You may experience a transformation in your thinking. It's bound to affect every aspect of your life, Cancer. By always questioning, you work through difficult issues that require a constant reshuffling of viewpoints. Feel free to open yourself up to new ways of thinking as you dismiss old ways that no longer serve you. Now is a terrific time to consider a fresh wave of thought. You'll be exposed to a new way of truth.
 ----- 
 You may be overwhelmed by an onslaught of communication from someone you didn't expect to hear from, Leo. It could be that this person suddenly puts a monkey wrench in your plans. It's important to adapt and allow for the constant changes that are bound to come your way. Don't get so hung up on a certain way of doing things that you fail to see the wisdom in a new and different approach.
 ----- 
 Someone might feel obligated to give you their two cents even if you didn't ask for it, Virgo. Be careful not to dismiss this information without giving it proper consideration. This knowledge comes to you for a reason, and it's possible that it's the very piece of information you need now in order to complete the puzzle. Don't disregard anything, regardless of how esoteric it seems.
 ----- 
 It's time to finally apply the knowledge you've accumulated and come to recognize the truth, Libra. Perhaps you've been sitting on the facts while contemplating their meaning. It's now time to get this information out into the open. There's no doubt that this action is likely to make waves, but that's OK. A key theme of the day is transformation, so feel free to contribute your part.
 ----- 
 When it comes to issues that require real thinking, be careful of letting someone else take control. You might have a rather lazy attitude in this department, Scorpio, and it could be tempting to simply let someone else do the thinking for you. This attitude is apt to lead you down the wrong path for you. Taking responsibility for yourself means thinking for yourself, so do it.
 ----- 
 There's likely to be a powerful force at work trying to manipulate the way you think about a certain situation, Sagittarius. Be conscious of the source of your facts. It could be that someone is giving you tainted information so you'll act in a way that is favorable to his or her plan. Others may not be looking out for your best interests, so it's important that you are. Don't accept things blindly without question.
 ----- 
 Don't second
 ----- 
 Other people may try to wield their power even when it isn't their place. This is one time when people may try to show off their IQ by offering random facts that don't offer anything useful to the situation at hand but just serve to prove their knowledge of esoteric trivia. Try not to buy into other people's displays of power, Aquarius. There's more than likely a great deal of hype and not much substance.
 ----- 
 Once your brain gets hooked on something, Pisces, you're likely to take it to the extreme. Be careful of overworking yourself in a certain issue that requires a more rational, temperate attitude. You may get into trouble if you insist on going off the deep end. Don't tackle issues you aren't ready to handle. Take things slowly and maintain a moderate, conservative viewpoint. If you go too far, back off and take a break.
 ----- 
 Things should be going your way right now, Aries. Feel confident about yourself and your decisions. Let your inner glow radiate outward and show people that you have a great deal of love to offer. Practice what you preach. You lose respect when you act contrary to the way in which you insist the people around you act. Feel your power from within as opposed to trying to get it from others.
 ----- 
 Follow through on your promises today, Taurus. You may be generous with your words and advice, but you might fall a bit short when it comes to actually delivering the goods. This is a great time to prove to others that you mean what you say. Do the things that you said you would. You'll be able to accomplish quite a bit as long as you maintain a focused and positive mindset.
 ----- 
 Don't get discouraged by other people's failures today, Gemini. There may be signs that warn you of potential roadblocks ahead, but this doesn't mean that you should turn your car around or give up on your goal. Perhaps you only need to slow down the pace or select a new route. Either way, you have the perseverance and inner drive to accomplish any task you undertake.
 ----- 
 Don't get thrown off your path, Cancer. Focus inward and concentrate on the tasks at hand. This may not be the most lighthearted and jovial day, but one must always take the good with the bad. Use the sober, grounding tone of today's energy to get down to business and stay there. Work now, play later! Remember the story about the ant and the grasshopper. Now is the time to store provisions for the future.
 ----- 
 Things should be flowing quite well for you today, Leo. Take this opportunity and use the energy to its full potential. Center yourself and look at the weeks ahead. Where do you want to be in two months? Where do you want to be in two years? Now is the time to take stock of what you've got and plan for future growth. You have a great deal going for you, so don't waste your time on frivolity.
 ----- 
 Today is a great day to gather data for a new project you're working on, Virgo. Put your nose to the grindstone and make some major progress on an important job. Find comfort in your work. Make sure, however, that the work you're engaged in is something that feeds your soul as opposed to just put money in your pocket. This is critical to maintaining a healthy mind and spirit.
 ----- 
 It's obvious how much you like to dream, Libra. Certainly, this is an important part of your existence. Realize that there comes a time when you must face reality. This is one of those days when you need to bite the bullet and deal with your bills. Take care of annoying errands that you've been putting off. Send the letters that have piled up on your desk for days. Stop making excuses.
 ----- 
 Stop wasting your energy on things that have no real relevance in your life, Scorpio. This is a day to focus your attention on the tasks at hand and get things done. Don't get distracted by the blinking neon lights. Stay tuned to your own channel. It might not be a bad idea to adopt more of a critical tone so you don't get caught up in issues that don't pertain to you.
 ----- 
 Delight in all your projects today, Sagittarius. You should enjoy a positive mood and pleasurable experiences with others. Let the good times roll. Your ego and emotions should be acting harmoniously. You have every reason to smile, so keep grinning from ear to ear. You're able to get a lot accomplished if you so choose. Adjust your compass, check the prevailing winds, and set sail.
 ----- 
 Today isn't a great day for inspiring enthusiasm in others, Capricorn. You might find that there's a sober, conservative tone to the day that's stealing the fuel from your fire. Realize that this is just part of the natural cycle of things. Don't feel that you need to be up and active all the time. Give yourself a rest and focus your energy inward. Settle your nerves and get down to business.
 ----- 
 Today is an excellent day in which you should be able to ground your emotions and find a greater amount of stability in your life. As you walk down the street, be conscious of the Earth below you. Plant your feet firmly on the ground and realize that you're a living part and product of this great planet. Don't separate yourself from Mother Nature 
 ----- 
 Realize that you're the one responsible for cleaning up your own mess, Pisces. If you've left your dirty clothes on the floor and the dishes unwashed, you will be the one who has to pay the consequences later on. Take responsibility for your actions. Today is an excellent day to do your laundry and clean the mess in the sink. You'll feel better about yourself and your immediate environment after you do.
 ----- 
 You might surprise a few people with your words and actions, which could seem out of character for you, Aries. Don't be surprised if you don't think or act like your normal self. There is a streak of the oddball inside you that wants to have its day in the spotlight. Let that part of you shine through by wearing your plaid pants with a polka dot shirt and furry orange hat. Wear bright, expressive colors that show off your willingness to stand out in a crowd.
 ----- 
 You could feel like a giant wrecking ball that's anxious to break down existing structures. Perhaps you're upset about a new development in your town, the country's political system, or the power structure within your home. Regardless of the exact reason, you're certain that change needs to happen in order to make progress. Often one must tear down an existing structure before a better one can be built.
 ----- 
 Keep pen and paper close by, Gemini, and have the number of the patent office on hand. You're apt to come up with some original ideas that could be revolutionary. You're likely be more intrigued by gadgets and electronic devices than usual. You have the power to make cunning observations about how things work. You may end up with a brilliant idea on how to improve the efficiency of an appliance in your house.
 ----- 
 You may have endless ideas streaming through your head but little patience to see any of them through to the end, Cancer. Perhaps you're so busy jumping from one thought to the next that you don't take any of them far enough to know whether or not they're worth pursuing. Write thoughts down as they come to you, and go over them later when your mind is in a quieter state.
 ----- 
 It's OK to change your opinion, Leo. You may pride yourself on being the solid one who always has an answer or knows exactly where to go. You may look upon others as flaky, indecisive, or fickle. It's important that you not shut down your thinking after making a decision about something. Keep your mind open to changes that occur around you and maybe you'll have a change of heart.
 ----- 
 You may feel a strong need to express your individuality, Virgo. You don't want to blend into the herd, unseen as you walk down the street. You want to be the sheep with the blue wool, the person skipping instead of walking. Find a place or group that lets you be yourself and not worry about what other people think about your style. Your originality is inspiring. Don't squelch it.
 ----- 
 Going with the flow may not necessarily appeal to you today, Libra. This is one time when you may want to be the fish swimming upstream while the school heads downstream. Feel free to go your own way regardless of what others have to say about it. You may get pressured by your loved ones to act a certain way or go somewhere special. Don't do these things just to please them. Do what pleases you.
 ----- 
 There are a few emotional surprises coming your way, Scorpio. You might act a certain way under normal circumstances, but today you're apt to take a completely different route. Perhaps you don't know why you suddenly feel comfortable about a situation that you'd normally be quite skeptical about. Nevertheless, this feeling is possible. Don't bother questioning your emotions. Simply roll with whatever circumstances come your way. You'll open many doors for yourself.
 ----- 
 You're apt to need emotional freedom, Sagittarius. Perhaps you sense that you're being coerced or manipulated into feeling a certain way and feel trapped in the situation. If you can distance yourself, you're likely to see that you're indeed getting caught up in someone else's drama. Right now it's imperative that you find an outlet where you can express yourself freely without feeling like you have to act a particular way.
 ----- 
 Take inventory of your habits and behaviors, Capricorn. Look to certain patterns and note the ones that do and don't work for you. You'll more than likely feel an urge to break free from repetition and create new paths that allow for other opportunities to come along. You may not even be consciously aware that in many ways you're beating a dead horse. Don't continue to waste your energy on paths that go nowhere.
 ----- 
 You may feel smothered by certain individuals and loved ones who hang on you like barnacles on a rock, Aquarius. You're a big part of their emotional support system and they rely on you for strength. Today, however, you could get frustrated by this extra weight. You'll more than likely want to rip those barnacles off in order to give you more breathing room. Freedom from others' emotional baggage is the key for today.
 ----- 
 You may end up scaring people with your dramatic, emotional outbursts, Pisces. Your behavior is likely to be erratic. The smallest things could set you off on a crazy tirade. The root of these issues probably has to do with a need to be loved, and you feel like others don't give you the attention you think you deserve. Try not to let your happiness depend so much on others' actions. The most important love is self
 ----- 
 Here's a reminder that it's OK to be you. You may feel more centered than usual, which encourages you to stand up for yourself and say the things you must to people who need to hear them. There may have been recent arguments with a partner, but those should subside now, thanks to today's serene feelings. Perhaps you've gained greater insight into the cause of the tension. Share this with the person you've been arguing with.
 ----- 
 You may have that awful feeling that you really need to get down to work yet something seems to stand square in the way of progress. Perhaps you feel like you're at a four
 ----- 
 You're anxious to take action, Gemini, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Be careful about acting too hastily. It's important that you and your loved one be on the same page first. You're probably ready to jump to the end of the book where everyone lives happily ever after. There's a whole story that has to play out first. Feel free to take aggressive action, but make sure that you temper it with a dash of common sense.
 ----- 
 It may feel as if something or someone is trying to keep you from moving ahead with your ambitious goals and aggressive nature, Cancer. At first you may resent this ball and chain attached to your ankle, but on closer examination, you'll see that this hindrance is actually a help. For now it's serving as an important reminder to slow down and do more thinking and planning before taking action.
 ----- 
 You're apt to feel more talkative than usual, Leo. There are many times when you may shrink from a situation in disgust or perhaps boredom. You're usually anxious to move from one scene and get on with the next. Feel free to call the shots and speak your mind. Others are more likely to listen to what you have to say, so be honest when someone comes to you with a question or situation that he or she needs help with.
 ----- 
 You may be anxious to try an uncharted path that speaks to your sense of risk and adventure, Virgo. It's important to temper these actions with realistic planning. You're much more likely to get a flat tire when you don't carry a spare. Make sure you have the proper resources to pull yourself out of any jam along the way. The old way of doing things is practical, tested, and tried and true for a reason, so don't dismiss it altogether.
 ----- 
 Other people are likely to be anxious to get up and moving with their plans, Libra. It might be better for you to hang back a bit and see how things pan out before you take action. Let others go across the river first to learn the best way. Do you take a boat, wade, or look for a bridge? Let someone else be the guinea pig so you'll have all the information you need to make the most prudent decision on how to proceed.
 ----- 
 Your heart has been active, Scorpio, and you're probably feeling the need to take charge of a certain relationship. Instead of being too hasty in your pursuit of this romance, you should probably do more planning. Look at the situation from a long
 ----- 
 There is solid grounding to your emotions right now that is helping you stabilize your sensitive feelings, Sagittarius. As you become more attuned to your internal needs, you may discover that recent actions in romance and love may not have been particularly appropriate. They could have seemed satisfying at the time, but on closer examination you may discover that you were compromising in order to make it seem like everything was working the way you wanted it to.
 ----- 
 Your relationships are going well from an intellectual perspective, Capricorn, but from an emotional one, you might feel like they aren't as fulfilling as you'd like. Perhaps you're letting your brain do too much of the driving. It's time to let your heart take over and have its needs be tended to for a while. As your energy shifts, so will that of people around you. Let them react however they will. Try not to be upset by the changes that follow.
 ----- 
 Concentrate on nurturing your needs right now instead of trying to accommodate the needs of others, Aquarius. There is a difficult tension that arises when you try to comfort someone who really doesn't want to be comforted. The best way to handle the situation is to leave the person alone and tend to your own emotions. If you're more stable and clear, you'll be better able to help others. Take this time to recharge your own batteries.
 ----- 
 Things may roll along nicely in love and romance and then suddenly run into a snag, Pisces. Perhaps you failed to recognize an important birthday or anniversary. Perhaps you were expected to act a certain way or do something you failed to do. Approach the person you hurt honestly and apologetically. You write your own rules. Your way may differ from someone else's, but that doesn't make it better or worse.
 ----- 
 New opportunities to advance your professional standing may arise, Aries. The aspects bode well for business and money. Promising new projects may present themselves. Your tendency to serve and nurture others should strengthen your work relationships, so morale on the job takes a tangible upswing at this time. Warmth and affection for friends, children, romantic partners, and even casual acquaintances should increase and enhance relationships.
 ----- 
 Restlessness may plague you throughout the day, Taurus, because you could be brimming over with physical energy but have no outlet for it. You might have to stay in and wait for something important, which could prove frustrating. Put on an exercise video and do aerobics while you wait. This isn't a good day to start new projects. Limit your social interactions to exercising with others at the gym.
 ----- 
 Though current business and money matters could well encounter obstacles, at this time you may find yourself reaping the rewards of past efforts. Your naturally persevering nature practically assures more success in the future, Gemini, even though you might be blocked now. New insights as to how to continue to progress could come your way today. It might be a good idea to write them down so you'll be assured of having them at your fingertips later.
 ----- 
 Today your powers of persuasion are at an all
 ----- 
 This day bodes well for accomplishments in business and finance. Long
 ----- 
 Your insight, creativity, and inventiveness are in full swing, Virgo, and new ideas come thick and fast. However, you might find yourself too caught up in boring, mundane tasks to do very much about it. Yet physical energy is plentiful, so you have it in you to take care of chores and then have time to do what you enjoy. You'll produce results if you remember to pace yourself. Work too hard and you'll be too tired!
 ----- 
 As a natural healer, you might find yourself experiencing a rush of transformative energy today, which you should put into practice. This is a great time to go for a massage or study natural healing modalities such as herbs or aromatherapy. Combine them with your innate healing abilities, Libra, and you might be happy with the results. Your mind is especially receptive right now. You'll retain more of what you learn than you usually would.
 ----- 
 Be prepared to work diligently toward making your dreams a reality today, Scorpio. Success is definitely on the way, though it may not be approaching quite as quickly as you might like. A lot of significant letters and phone calls could come your way, keeping you busy. Don't allow yourself to get too frazzled, though. Take time periodically throughout the day to sit quietly and recoup your energy.
 ----- 
 You could find it harder than usual to wake up this morning, Sagittarius, as your energy may be flagging. Personal or professional pressures might stir feelings of futility, but don't fall into this trap. In spite of your momentary lethargy, everything on the horizon looks far better than it seems 
 ----- 
 Today it might suddenly hit you that you have a lot of unfinished tasks that need to be completed, and this might lead to a case of the blues. Take heart! The process appears more overwhelming than it is, Capricorn. A little planning and focused discipline should enable you to get through everything without stressing yourself out too much. In the evening, reward yourself with a meal out or a movie.
 ----- 
 Business and financial matters look promising today, Aquarius, but you could find yourself torn between the need to attend to these matters and the desire to relax at home. If you have to make a choice, it might be best to choose the former, because today's aspects promise opportunities that might not come around again for a while. The evening should be your own. Plan an intimate dinner with a lover. You'll like the results!
 ----- 
 Today, Pisces, matters surrounding business and finances need immediate attention, and this could prove a bit disheartening. Do you have a lot of unfinished tasks that have piled up? Gear up and get to them. They aren't going away, and you'll feel better about everything when they're out of the way. You might find that clearing up these old matters allows new opportunities to flow your way.
 ----- 
 You may be feeling a bit reserved today, Aries, especially when it comes to issues involving love and romance. Follow your instincts and know that your hesitation isn't unfounded. Sometimes it's good to slow down and question the road you're on. Just don't doubt yourself to the point that you become too frustrated that you can't take the next big step forward.
 ----- 
 Reclaim control of things that might be holding you back now, Taurus. You may find that there's an element of restriction to the day that's keeping you from getting where you want to be. Try the best you can to relax and stabilize your emotions. Interaction with people who are older and wiser is likely to shed some important perspective on things today. Heed advice from those who have been through similar situations.
 ----- 
 Be selective when it comes to expressing your passion today, Gemini. Remember that less is more. You don't have to use a tremendous number of bells and whistles in order to get your point across. Let your actions be minimal but meaningful. You can say a great deal with few words. There's more to your glance than meets the eye. The unwary prey has no chance against your hypnotic stare.
 ----- 
 In general, your spirit is upbeat, freedom loving, and adventurous, Cancer. Today, however, you might find that it's a bit more intense and possibly somber, especially when it comes to romantic issues. This approach to matters of the heart isn't exactly your normal style, but you're apt to find that it's appropriate for your situation now. Make sure you have the right tools for the job at hand.
 ----- 
 It's important for you not to overanalyze every little detail of your situation now, Leo, especially when it comes to love and romance issues. You could be jumping to ridiculous conclusions based purely on circumstantial evidence. Don't lose sleep over things that you don't even know to be true. Release your stranglehold on certain issues and concentrate on simply rebuilding your own self
 ----- 
 When it comes to love and romance, you may find yourself in a bit of a pickle, Virgo. There's a request for greater commitment now. You may be unsure about how to respond. You may hesitate to give up the sense of freedom that you hold so dear. Recognize the importance of a close connection with one other person. Give yourself the opportunity to experience this kind of intense relationship on a more permanent basis.
 ----- 
 Your romantic, sensitive nature comes alive today, Libra, and you may find yourself searching for the security of a close lover. You're apt to be pickier than usual 
 ----- 
 Tension in your romantic life is apt to well up today, Scorpio. More than likely, there are certain responsibilities that you feel you have to attend to that take you away from your intimate experience with another. Whether or not you're currently involved in a romantic partnership, the day's energy is likely to stir up issues regarding love and romance. Try to find a healthy balance between work and play.
 ----- 
 You could be feeling the pressure of time now, Sagittarius. At this point in your life you may be more aware than ever of your limited time left on this planet. Perhaps you're thinking more about love and romance and how much they mean to you. Consider the limitations of each, but don't dwell on them. The important thing is to embrace today and make the most of the time and love you have now.
 ----- 
 Situations regarding love and romance are likely to get much heavier and more intense now, Capricorn. Are you ready to make a deeper commitment to the one you love? It may be quite hard for you to make a solid commitment because you could be wary of the freedom you'll lose. Now is the time to face the music and really dedicate yourself to the people who mean the most to you.
 ----- 
 The love and romance department should be going pretty well for you now, Aquarius. This is the time to probe more deeply into your current affair with that person who catches your eye. There's a greater sensitivity to your emotions today, and you could find yourself holding back a bit more than usual. An air of mystery and intrigue will surround you, drawing others toward you like a moth to a candle.
 ----- 
 Your incredible passion and creativity are taking center stage, Pisces. It's also quite possible that there's a great restlessness within you egging you on to take things to the next level. Combine your powers of dedication with your flair for the dramatic to accomplish whatever it is your heart desires. You have the power within you to shine especially bright on a day like today.
 ----- 
 You may be in an especially nurturing mood today, Aries. You might reach out to every living thing around you, from plants to pets to friends, children, and romantic partners. There's a danger of being too helpful and supportive, which some could find stifling. Your loved ones like to see you relaxed and happy, so channel some energy into indulging yourself. Go for a massage or other treat. Live a little!
 ----- 
 Social responsibilities might appear to be hitting you all at once. Everyone you know seems to crave your company. As a naturally polite and socially astute person, you might feel obligated to accept any and all invitations. This isn't a good day to commit yourself. Wait a while until you're feeling a little more balanced, then send out your responses. Commit only to those events you would genuinely enjoy.
 ----- 
 Important communications regarding finances could come today, Gemini, and it might be fortuitous if you follow up on them right away. Once that's done, you'll probably want to relax and delve into whatever interests you the most. It might be a good idea to read a book, since your mind is especially sharp. Take breaks in the fresh air. Ideas and insights should come quickly, so take notes.
 ----- 
 Your sensual side is likely to show itself today, Cancer. You might find yourself viewing young folks in tight jeans more appreciatively than you usually do. Racy novels and movies might also suddenly seem appealing. Romantic encounters are intense and passionate, so make sure you allow plenty of time for them. Enjoy yourself!
 ----- 
 Ingenious techniques for growing your money could come your way today, Leo. While you aren't one to jump into anything, you're certainly likely to give these ideas serious thought. Take care to only go for those that are totally up front, with no hidden sides. Your passion for delving into new professional fields is only surpassed by your romantic passions. Plan a seductive evening with a partner. Make it a night to remember!
 ----- 
 Today you're likely to be in just the right place at the right time to meet the right person. You're overdue for a lucky break and probably not expecting it. You may start the day in a restless and frustrated state of mind, Virgo, but whatever happens will catapult you out of it. Be prepared 
 ----- 
 You might wake up this morning, look in the mirror, and decide that you hate what you see even though you probably look fine. This is a good day to shop for new clothes or get a haircut. Perhaps you feel a little blue. Getting out and indulging yourself is more a necessity than luxury. Don't overindulge in food or drink now, Libra. You might not like the consequences tomorrow!
 ----- 
 Today you could find yourself seeking self
 ----- 
 Do you have a romantic evening planned for tonight, Sagittarius? If so, it's likely to turn out to be all you'd hoped for. You'll be especially attractive, and your naturally warm and loving nature will be very apparent. Even casual encounters with friends may bring about closer bonding, and new acquaintances are likely to become friends. Your communicative skills are good now, and people will likely respond to you. Go for it!
 ----- 
 You could feel restless and anxious to get out in the open for a while today, Capricorn, but mundane tasks could force you to postpone it. Someone you care about might ask for a favor, and while you may not want to help this person, you probably will. Don't let your irritation show 
 ----- 
 At some point during the day you might find yourself involved in a project that piques your interest far more than usual. You could throw yourself more deeply into it than is necessary now. Take care that it doesn't distract you from what needs to be done, Aquarius. Your wisdom is especially sharp, and you can use your intuition to gain valuable practical knowledge. Spend the evening meditating.
 ----- 
 Pisces, are you hoping to accomplish a goal that you've been working toward for a long time? Don't let delays cause you to fear that it will never happen. It could block your creative energy and cause you to lose faith in yourself. Fortunate changes are in the wind, but it's still going to take a little more effort to get where you want to be. Keep going. You'll get there!
 ----- 
 New communications equipment may make whatever work you do that much easier to do, Aries. You might have some doubts about your ability to use it, but don't worry. You'll be able to deal with it as well as anyone. You'll find that it will open up new doors for you, both with regard to compiling information and staying in contact with old and new friends. Go to it!
 ----- 
 A long
 ----- 
 Too much is on your mind right now, Gemini, and so you could have trouble sleeping. When you do manage to drop off, you could experience bizarre dreams. This is the only downside to your present situation, however. Everything else should be going very well. It might help to take a walk at night before you go to bed. This clears your head, gets the endorphins going, and works off excess energy.
 ----- 
 Some enlightening conversations could occur today with a partner, Cancer, possibly romantic, possibly career
 ----- 
 Hard work on a particular enterprise for too long a time could finally lead to an increase in income, Leo. Creativity or innovation could be involved. Don't be surprised if you find yourself on the receiving end of compliments. You'll be feeling proud and confident, and you certainly have good reason. Buy yourself a present. Take your partner out for a celebration. You deserve it.
 ----- 
 You tend to be adventurous at the calmest of times, Virgo. Today you could be feeling especially daring. You might be tempted to make some radical changes in your life, particularly where your profession is concerned. You could decide to make your living in an offbeat way, or possibly move to a place you've never considered before. Think about it for a few days. The impetus might pass. If it doesn't, then follow your heart.
 ----- 
 You tend to be rather intuitive, Libra, but today your psychic abilities could seem more focused than usual. You're better able to tune in to thoughts, feelings, and events. If you give readings, this is a good day for it, because you're apt to be more accurate than usual. Don't do too many or you could lose your focus and not do anyone else any good. Work steadily and pace yourself.
 ----- 
 Today your mind is apt to be turning to discussions of money, Scorpio. Conversations, perhaps job related, perhaps social encounters with friends, could turn to the subject of new income opportunities through modern technology. This is a good time to look into such matters, although you'll probably want to consider several before making a decision. Unless you absolutely know what you want, shop around!
 ----- 
 New opportunities, perhaps involving writing or speaking, could appear on the horizon along with the current planetary energy, Sagittarius. You aren't one to take risks on the spur of the moment, so you might want to take all the information into consideration before committing to anything. It isn't a good idea to wait too long. Things could change! If what you hear appeals to you, look into it so you don't miss the boat.
 ----- 
 Letters, phone calls, or emails from afar could put you in touch with new, interesting people. These people could well bring some fascinating ideas your way, Capricorn. Shared knowledge can lead to mutual advancement on material and spiritual levels. This process just might turn a casual acquaintance into a firm friend. Expect a lot of contact with these people for a long time to come. Enjoy your day.
 ----- 
 The current aspects encourage cultivating your spirituality, Aquarius. However advanced you are on your spiritual journey, there are revelations, awakenings, and new experiences waiting. Visit a church or a secluded spot in nature that speaks to you and soak up the energy. Indulge in some investigation. Check out some books on spirituality and symbols, and pay attention to your dreams.
 ----- 
 A new opportunity could come your way today, Pisces. It might seem like a dream come true, the chance you've been waiting for, but you'll still want to think about it a bit. The reason is that it could well disrupt your life, including your romantic circumstances. Before you commit to anything, check the facts carefully to make sure it's as good as it seems. Either way, you'll be glad you did.
 ----- 
 Today might be a bit difficult, Aries, because you aren't likely to be as productive as usual. You won't have much to say, and you'll feel sleepy and somewhat grumpy. In other words, it's the perfect day to go back to bed with that novel. Take a nap 
 ----- 
 You certainly are in a strange mood today, Taurus. True, things have been going smoothly for the past few days, but be careful not to fool yourself. "Pride comes before a fall," as the expression goes. You should be wary of the way you treat your lover now. You're likely to be dismayed by your sweetie's attitude, yet you're the one who has strayed from reality.
 ----- 
 It will be as though you're in a new, hopeful world today, Gemini. The people you meet will be cordial and caring, and the future will seem like a bright, attractive place to live. In other words, you feel as though you're living in a fabulous dream. Alas, the alarm clock is bound to wake you up soon. Enjoy the sweet reality of the day ahead while it lasts.
 ----- 
 Because your tendency recently has been to brood over everything, Cancer, a day like this can't be anything but beneficial. It has been difficult for you to find material satisfaction of late, but today offers you a view into the world of the intangible and unreal. You may find it especially gratifying to participate in an artistic or religious activity.
 ----- 
 There are days when you feel wonderful without being able to attribute the feeling to any real event. Of course, your rational mind will search for a reason for the happiness. If you count the number of times when you do things against your will or better judgment, it becomes obvious that logic and reason don't always apply to this world. Don't even try to understand, Leo, just enjoy!
 ----- 
 The day ahead should be excellent. You've been searching for meaning behind recent events. No doubt there have been a lot of changes both at work and at home. You're bursting with new ambition. Today, Virgo, you're likely to put all these experiences into the hopper, stir them up, and be grateful for the thrilling life you lead right now! You may not get a specific answer. Sometimes feeling grateful is an answer all its own.
 ----- 
 You'll probably be perfectly in tune with the day ahead, Libra. Of course, there are days when it's tempting to run away from the reality of the moment and its hardships. At times like today, you're so compassionate that you find it easy to listen to others, and life is truly rewarding. People find your company soothing and pleasant, and they are likely to thank you for it.
 ----- 
 Don't even try to understand what's happening today, Scorpio, because you won't be able to fathom it. Collective currents of concern are imposing upon your life and you're powerless to stop them. Some soul searching may help. True, at the moment you do feel like you're just a grain of sand in a vast universe, but is that really so bad?
 ----- 
 This kind of strange day doesn't occur often, Sagittarius. You no longer seem to know what you want. Work or time off? Redecorate your house or live in a beach shack? It's hard to communicate because you feel it's pointless to try to explain your point of view, especially when you don't know what it is. The best thing to do may be to unplug from your usual activities and go for a walk. This confusion will pass.
 ----- 
 Do countries abroad represent real opportunities for you, Capricorn? This is a question that you'll soon have to answer. The grass may be greener on the other side of the world, but have you considered the possibility that it isn't? Could it be that the dream of working abroad is a convenient explanation for the dissatisfaction you feel at work? It's important to solve this riddle, because you'll soon make some key decisions that depend on the answer.
 ----- 
 Today won't be like most other days, Aquarius. Look around and you'll see that people either have their heads in the clouds, are depressed, or seem to be trying to keep up a good front. The planetary atmosphere is such that a lot of people 
 ----- 
 If you were offered the opportunity to take a trip around the world, where you would see wonderful palaces and experience a timeless love affair, would you take it? The freedom would tempt you, without a doubt, but would it make you happy, Pisces? Have you considered the possibility that you can create an environment here at home that gives you that same sense of freedom?
 ----- 
 Relations with those you care about continue to be warm and supportive. Friends may want to pitch in and help you with a project, Aries, or you could lend a hand to someone else. Strong bonds with others could be forged at this time, which might lead to firm and lasting friendships in the future. This is also a good day to turn your attention to repairing, redecorating, or refurnishing your home.
 ----- 
 A strong sense of inspiration that seems to come from the higher planes could boost your natural artistic abilities, Taurus. No matter how rushed you may be with other tasks, it's important to take time to note your ideas. They're definitely worth pursuing and you'll want to refer to them later. If you're thinking about a friend, give that person a call. He or she might have news for you.
 ----- 
 Although you might feel a bit inclined toward solitude today, Gemini, don't indulge it. This is a great day to get out with friends and meet new people, if possible, particularly women. You can forge closer bonds at this time, and you might also make valuable business contacts that prove profitable in the future. Affectionate communication with a romantic partner can make your day. Take the evening to enjoy a tête
 ----- 
 An appealing new face could appear on the scene today, Cancer. This might lead to a new friendship, although this person could be charming enough to bring out your insecurities. Put these aside 
 ----- 
 A male friend could put you in touch with people from foreign countries or people who have traveled a lot. They might have valuable information that you could use later. This information could also help you finish old projects that have been waiting to be done. Your eye for detail is especially acute, Leo. Make notes of interesting facts even if they don't apply right now. You'll make good use of them later.
 ----- 
 You're probably feeling especially sexy, Virgo, and you might want to take a lover out for a romantic dinner, if possible. You would especially enjoy going all out, experimenting with a new outfit, scent, or hairstyle. On a more mundane note, investments of either time or money should pay off today, as could hard work performed in the past. Have a great day!
 ----- 
 Romance and marriage are very much on your mind today, Libra. A special conversation with a possible love partner could have you hankering for happily ever after. Books on attracting and maintaining relationships might be especially appealing as well as useful. Take care not to put too much stock in detailed analyses, however. Remember that such books are based on generalities. You're unique.
 ----- 
 You're feeling especially healthy, energetic, and attractive today, Scorpio, and some friends may suddenly see you in a new light. This could bring a valuable boost in self
 ----- 
 Your natural warmth and loving nature should be more apparent than usual today, Sagittarius. You're likely to attract new people, both men and women, into your aura. Perhaps old friends you haven't seen for a while suddenly reappear on the scene. This is an excellent time to plan a social event or invite a friend to lunch, if possible. You might also want to fix yourself up and plan a romantic evening!
 ----- 
 Friction with family members, particularly women, could prove irritating, especially since you're torn between their quirks and the love you have for them. This isn't the time to hold grudges, Capricorn. Let them go. You might feel the urge to do some home repairs, redecorate, or otherwise improve your home, or perhaps cook a great meal. Channel your energy into these activities instead of quarreling. You'll be glad you did.
 ----- 
 Today should bring pleasant and profitable communications with women, possibly some new friends. A lot of people will want talk to you, although perhaps more than you can realistically handle. Be careful not to commit to too many things. You could end up spreading yourself too thin. Travel to faraway lands may seem tempting at this time, Aquarius, but that might not be possible for some time. Relax and enjoy the company for now.
 ----- 
 New opportunities may give you a chance to increase your financial standing and expand yourself professionally. Innovations that you've produced in the past have attracted the attention of those in positions of authority, Pisces, and the fruits of your labor may manifest now. Don't expect to be able to relax and enjoy them, however, as a lot of effort still lies ahead. Summon all your inner resources and charge ahead.
 ----- 
 Your financial affairs could look especially rosy now, Aries. Some benefits are definitely coming your way, although everything isn't quite as promising as it seems. You could well find yourself with less than you were hoping for. Think of whatever gain may be coming as something extra, but don't count on it. That way, whatever comes will be a welcome bonus rather than an irritating disappointment.
 ----- 
 You should be happier than usual with what you see in the mirror, Taurus, because your inner beauty is more visible than usual. You could also feel especially sociable. Both old friends and new should find your company especially congenial. Romance blossoms, although there's a slight tendency today to see partners through rose
 ----- 
 Today you might find yourself more inclined than usual to actively explore your interests in the arts, Gemini. You might want to look at an online art gallery or attend a virtual concert or play. Your interest could be in the motivations of the artists as much as the works themselves. Don't be surprised if you're especially drawn to the more tormented great artists like Beethoven or Van Gogh.
 ----- 
 A female friend you haven't seen for a while could surprise you with a call. A lot of interesting news and useful information could be exchanged that benefits both of you. You may make a number of short journeys throughout the day, Cancer, as you have a lot that needs doing. A small increase in income could also be in the works. In the evening, rent a romantic video.
 ----- 
 With the current aspects at play, Leo, you could find that the hard work you've done in the past finally brings financial rewards. This will make you very happy, but don't get carried away and go on a spending spree! Treat yourself a little. Celebrate with a friend, if possible. Take care to exercise a little good sense. You don't want to buy too much and have to take a lot of it back to the store.
 ----- 
 Today, Virgo, you might find yourself thinking longingly of exotic lands and possibly traveling to them in the future. You could also wonder about the people who live in those countries. Romantic daydreams may distract you from your day
 ----- 
 A small sum of money could come your way today, Libra. It could be that someone pays you what's owed you, or you could win a small amount in a lottery. You might find a $20 bill lying in the street! Sex and romance are very much on your mind. If you can't get together with a partner this evening, you might curl up with a steamy novel or watch a romantic video.
 ----- 
 Your romantic side is flying high today, Scorpio. The opposite sex in general and your own partner in particular are going to seem especially attractive to you. You could also see in an entirely different light someone you think of as a friend. An increasingly busy social life in the future is possible, so expect to hear rumblings about parties or other social events.
 ----- 
 New people you meet today are likely to be favorably impressed by your manners, social skills, and, above all, excellent sense of humor. Don't be surprised if all of this brings you some new opportunities today! Your health is radiant, and you are probably looking great. This is an excellent time to plan an evening out with friends or, better yet, a romantic partner if possible.
 ----- 
 Romantic feelings blossom today, Capricorn. You may suddenly appear more attractive than usual. Lovers and potential lovers may seem unusually attentive. You could also be feeling very creative, and you might want to try your hand at poetry or fiction. Reading romantic novels or seeing romantic movies could also be appealing. Surround yourself with candles, flowers, and music, and enjoy!
 ----- 
 You could wake up this morning, look around, and decide you want to spend as much time as possible working on your home, Aquarius. You could be bored with the decor and want to make some changes. Spend the day coming up with ideas and then tonight try to analyze the situation and see what's feasible now. Most likely you'll be able to do some but not all of what you want.
 ----- 
 Today, Pisces, you could receive an affectionate, supportive letter or phone call from someone close to you. Communications with others should go smoothly, and intelligent conversations could well take place. A favorite author, musician, or actor could release a new book, album, or movie that you'll want to jump on right away. Or you might want to try your hand at such enterprises yourself. You do have the talent.
 ----- 
 The possibility of some future houseguests might have you checking your home to see what needs to be done to make it presentable. It may need a few minor repairs, Aries, and you could do some online shopping to dress the place up a little. Books might give you some workable ideas. Your mind might be working more quickly than your body, however. Take care not to push yourself too hard.
 ----- 
 Today you might decide to participate in activities involving children, Taurus. Field trips either for pleasure or educational purposes may take place, if possible, and you could enjoy it as much as the kids. Letters and phone calls could bring good news from far away, which you'll almost certainly want to pass on to others. Tonight, curl up with the latest mystery. Intrigue should be especially appealing now.
 ----- 
 Your financial situation looks particularly good right now. An increase in income could be coming your way, Gemini. The downside could be that contracts might be involved, and you'll have to spend time perusing boring legal documents that need to be executed. A lot of people could reach out to you tonight, probably to exchange ideas and information. Dont talk or text for too long. You'll want to get some sleep!
 ----- 
 Recent developments have brought new interests into your life, Cancer. As a result, you might be seriously considering enrolling in a formal course of study in the future involving these subjects. If you really want to do this, it's definitely the right time to start planning. Others in your community might want to do the same, so a discussion on the subject might help. Books and magazines could also be useful.
 ----- 
 Your mind is especially sharp, Leo. You're logical and objective by nature. However, today you're likely to find that your thinking is more influenced by feeling than usual. This is a positive development. It demonstrates that your intuition is operating at a high level, so don't fight it. This is definitely the day to follow your heart rather than your head.
 ----- 
 A group you're involved with may want to discuss a future trip of some kind, Virgo, perhaps to a convention. The drive to expand your horizons is very strong today. Therefore, trips like this or other opportunities to learn and grow can be especially appealing. You might come up with a few ideas of your own that you prefer to pursue alone. Give it some thought!
 ----- 
 Your intuition is operating at a very high level today, Libra. You tend to follow your heart by nature, so you don't always go out of your way to be logical or objective. However, more than one event could occur during the day in which it's imperative that you go with your intuition even though it defies all logic. Have a little faith and go with your gut!
 ----- 
 Today should be a gratifying day, Scorpio, full of great news, pleasant surprises, and opening doors of opportunity on just about every level. Career breaks and chances to earn more money could come your way. New friends may be introduced to you, and future opportunities for education and travel also may arise. Whatever actually manifests out of all this is up to you. You might find decisions difficult.

 Paperwork involving financial transactions may need to be handled today, Sagittarius, but it won't be as tedious as you think. Whatever information is required is easily obtained. Most of what is presented to you should be clear and understandable, and the people involved helpful. It's important that you do get this done. If you wait, it might not go as smoothly. In the evening, schedule a romantic encounter, if possible. Your level of passion is rather high!
 ----- 
 A friend could put you in touch with a lot of interesting people, some in fields such as law, education, or the ministry.

 ----- 
 You may spend much of your day trying to sort out financial matters for yourself, your job, or perhaps for a friend or relative, Aquarius.

The fact is that incredible breakthroughs can be made through disagreements among different types of people.
 ----- 
 Try to seek freedom and new experiences today, Taurus. This is an important time for you to spread your wings and explore.

Perhaps there's an important lesson you need to learn. Be more assertive in your actions, and don't let people walk all over you.
 ----- 
 If people insist on having things their own way, let them, Gemini. Fighting isn't going to do any good. This kind of reaction will only cause more tension between you and the other person involved. Approaching the situation with a hostile attitude will most likely result in a lose/lose situation. If arguments do occur, try not to take things personally. Try your hardest to stick with the facts.
 ----- 
 Suddenly you've found your energy again. Your engine is oiled up and ready to go, Cancer. Put yourself in high gear and don't let anything stand in your way.

Take things to a higher level and don't be afraid to suggest radical change.
 ----- 
 You may be a bit daunted by the frenzy of energy present in the air today, Leo. Try not to get thrown off balance by others who may be more abrasive than usual.

You have the power to make very significant breakthroughs.
 ----- 
 It's time to implement the plans you fostered as a result of internal processes over the past few days, Libra. Hop in the driver's seat and take control.

Remember that if people criticize you, it's because they love you.
 ----- 
 Your mood should be quite good today, Scorpio. Generally, you'll find that people will react to your tendency to take the lead.

The route to take today is the one that fosters diversity and revolutionary thinking. Be a pioneer in every situation.
 ----- 
 Be a little braver than usual today, Sagittarius. Take some risks and show others that you have the strength to accomplish anything.

 ----- 
 Interaction with others may not be especially satisfying for you today, Aquarius. You could get the feeling that other people don't really care as much as you thought they did.

Give others the benefit of the doubt.
 ----- 
 The clouds have finally lifted, and you should be able to see clearly again, Pisces. The fire is burning red hot and you'll find people likely to stick up for themselves more than usual.

 ----- 
 It may be difficult to stay grounded today with all the information flying around and the emotions roiling in your heart. Try not to take things too seriously, Aries. This is the key to maintaining a level head throughout the day. Do things with passion and take care of any detective work that needs to be done. There are important facts coming to you from unexpected sources.
 ----- 
 You may get pushed around by two very powerful camps today, Taurus. Since you're the kind, diplomatic, and sensitive one, you make the perfect target for more abrasive and opinionated people. You may want to side with the cold, hard facts presented to you, although there's a great deal of emotional power stirring the pot. Things may not be as clear as they seem at first glance.

Take care of any detective work that needs doing.
 ----- 
 You may be seduced by fantastic promises that offer wonderful things and fanciful rewards. But beware of anything with lots of bells and whistles, Virgo.

 ----- 
 People are apt to be quite emotional when it comes to the appearance they wish to project today, Libra, so be careful where you step.

The key is not to be fooled by those who hide behind a facade built more by society than by themselves.
 ----- 
 Scorpio, don't be surprised if some of your fantasies and dreams are put on trial today by a harsh force that cuts right to the truth of the matter. People are apt to be extra passionate about things. Most aren't going to be impressed with Disney
 ----- 
 You've reached an emotionally climactic point right now, Sagittarius, and you could find some harsh opposition coming at you for no apparent reason. There is a stubborn, strong, oppressive force today, and you should be aware that the more rigid your viewpoint, the harder it will be for any resolution at all.

 ----- 
 Be careful not to be too cavalier today, Capricorn. It would be wise to adopt a more serious tone than you normally would.

 -----

Realize that this arena is quite heated and that the forces at work are extremely stubborn.
 ----- 
 The fantasy world that you've built for yourself is a pleasure to behold, Pisces. People frolic in your world and have a grand time. Your presence delights people with pleasure.

Be prepared to stand your ground.
 ----- 
 This is a great day to develop any latent talents you've wanted to explore, Aries, particularly those involving the arts. You might want to try working with friends who have the same talent.

 ----- 
 Today you might feel especially artistic, particularly regarding the visual arts. A lot of exalted ideas could come your way, Taurus, perhaps inspired by the masters of the past.

Take time to write down your thoughts since you'll want to remember them. Enjoy!

 You're a deep thinker by nature, Gemini, and today your mind may not be in this world. Books on psychology and metaphysics could be appealing.

You might feel too fanciful to be your usual practical self.
